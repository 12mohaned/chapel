Log message:
	Still ashamed for my former sloppiness, made Makefile.base even more
	bulletproof (perhaps overly so :).  Made a rule such that if PLATFORM
	is set to unknown, it prints out a message indicating that the
	platform is not recognized and exits.
	
	In order to make this rule not be the first (and therefore default)
	rule in every Makefile that includes Makefile.base, I added a rule
	"default:" that depends on "all".  Thus, "all" should be the first
	target of every Makefile that we make (this seems to be the convention
	we both favor anyway, so hopefully this isn't too much of an
	imposition).
	
	Also added a Makefile to the make/ directory that prints out all the
	PLATFORM/OS/ARCH information.

Log message:
	Improved the Makefile so that clean would remove prim_data.cpp and so
	that a clean build would work without being run twice (previously, it
	seemed to trip over prim_data.cpp being missing the first time and
	then worked the second time).
	
	Improved the .cvsignore files to ignore things created during the
	run of the sample program.

Log message:
	Took a cue from John's mail yesterday and removed the optional
	inclusion of Makefile.$(PLATFORM) to create errors on an unknown
	platform.  Then realized that by moving the rules I'd added to
	Makefile.base to create a nice error message to Makefile.unknown, I
	could still get nice error messages on an unknown platform.
