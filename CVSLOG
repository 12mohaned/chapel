Log message:
	Still ashamed for my former sloppiness, made Makefile.base even more
	bulletproof (perhaps overly so :).  Made a rule such that if PLATFORM
	is set to unknown, it prints out a message indicating that the
	platform is not recognized and exits.
	
	In order to make this rule not be the first (and therefore default)
	rule in every Makefile that includes Makefile.base, I added a rule
	"default:" that depends on "all".  Thus, "all" should be the first
	target of every Makefile that we make (this seems to be the convention
	we both favor anyway, so hopefully this isn't too much of an
	imposition).
	
	Also added a Makefile to the make/ directory that prints out all the
	PLATFORM/OS/ARCH information.

Log message:
	This change is a revamping of the make system, in an attempt to
	make it more modular and more understandable (to myself, at least,
	and hopefully to new implementors as well).
	
	This isn't a perfect check-in:  since compiler code is created
	dynamically, it is difficult to establish dependences for those
	bits of code that are dynamic.  It was hard enough to establish
	proper dependences for those bits of code that #include dynamically-
	created files.  So the main limitation of this version is that
	dependences for dynamically created files (make_prims.cpp,
	*.g.d_parser.cpp, cast_code.cpp) are not generated.  This will be
	fixed when I revisit the topic (probably by keeping these
	dependences under compiler control -- yuck; or simply by requiring
	developers who want such dependences to run make depend after
	they've completed a successful make (also yuck).  Alternatively,
	we could put all code under CVS control, even if it is dynamically
	generated (I'm not sure how fast some of these files change, so
	don't know if this makes sense).
	
	The general organization strategy here is:
	
	- put each binary in its own directory (for understandability)
	- teach the Makefiles how to make everything (so developers don't need
	to know how)
	- no automatic updating of dependences -- developers must do it
	manually
	
	The new directory structure is:
	
	compiler/     -- code for the compiler
	make/       -- stores common Makefile variables, rules
	cast/       -- code to build cast
	make_prims/ -- code to build make_prims
	test/       -- unit tests for the compiler
	
	where each of these subdirectories has a platform-specific
	subdirectory for storing object files, dependence information,
	etc.
	
	The Makefile in compiler/ currently responds to:
	
	all: recursively builds subdirectories, then builds self
	clean: cleans all subdirectories, self
	depend: updates dependences for CVS-controlled sources in
	subdirectories, self
	cleandeps: remove all dependence information in
	subdirectories, self
	clobber: clean up "everything" not under CVS control
	test: builds and runs unit tests
	
	The subdirectories are each structured in a fairly similar way so that
	they can share a bunch of common Makefile rules and variables (stored
	in the compiler/make/ subdirectory) and so that these rules can be
	changed once and affect all the subdirectories.
	
	This took way more work than I expected, due mostly to the existence
	of dynamically generated sources, which threw more monkey wrenches at
	me than I imagined.  I documented some of the problems I was running
	into in make/Makefile.NOTES so that in future changes I don't retread
	over the same path again.

Log message:
	First version of the regression test system.
	
	Instructions for use (from the top of the start_test script):
	
	--------------------
	
	Executive Summary: The overall flow of the testing system is that it
	will recursively descend into subdirectories looking for Chapel
	programs to compile and run (*.chpl) as well as for other tests to
	run (sub_test).  The output of these runs will typically be logged
	in a file stored in the Logs/ subdirectory, as will a summary of the
	errors reported (determined by grepping for the string "[Error", so
	don't have your program print this out.
	
	Here's the directory structure:
	
	Bin/     -- contains binary files/scripts required by the testing
	system, such as the timedexec script which kills a
	test if it takes too long
	Logs/    -- logs of testing runs go here by default
	Samples/ -- sample tests go here; these are for illustration only
	and won't be run by default.  To try running the
	test system against these samples, use:
	start_test -startdir ./Samples
	*/       -- all other directories will contain tests
	
	The start_test script kicks off all the action.  With no arguments,
	it will run all the tests using the defaults.  The '-h' option lists
	the options that the script accepts and the default values.  Current
	options are:
	
	option     argument               default value
	---------  ---------------------  -------------
	-compiler  <compiler executable>  ../compiler/chpl
	-compopts  <option list>          ""
	-execopts  <option list>          ""
	-startdir  <test subdir>          .
	-logfile   <log filename>         ./Logs/<username>.log
	
	The -compiler option allows the user to specify the compiler to test
	if it is something other than the obvious one in the current CVS
	structure.  This lets one run other people's compilers, old copies
	of compilers, etc.
	
	The -compopts option allows the user to specify a set of compiler
	options that should be used on every invocation to the compiler.
	Additional compiler options can be specified on a directory-by-
	directory basis.
	
	The -execopts option allows the user to specify a set of execution
	options that should be used on every invocation of a program.  As
	with compiler options, these can be ammended in each subdirectory.
	
	The -startdir option allows the user to specify a subdirectory of
	the testing system to start in (and limit itself to).  Assuming
	that tests are sorted into subdirectories by useful features, this
	allows you to run a subset of the tests easily.
	
	The -logfile option indicates where the log of the test run should
	be kept.  By default it's based on the user's name.  If the log
	file already exists, you will be prompted at the beginning of the
	run whether you want to delete that file or not.  At the end of
	the run, a second log file named <logfile>.summary will be
	generated containing only the Errors that were logged.
	
	By default, setting up a subdirectory for testing simply consists
	of creating the directory, putting Chapel (.chpl) source files
	into it and an expected output file (.chk) for each source file
	(using the same base name).  Upon reaching such a directory, the
	testing system will run the specified compiler on each Chapel
	source file using the specified compiler options, then (assuming
	the compile completed successfully, execute the resulting program
	using the specified execution options.  The output from both the
	compilation and the execution are concatenated and diff'd against
	the .chk file.  This allows programs that are supposed to generate
	errors, warnings, and correct programs to all be tested using the
	same mechanisms.
	
	Particular subdirectories can also be customized if necessary.
	Note that such customizations are not inherited recursively by
	further subdirectories, but apply only to the directory in
	question (we might consider changing this in future versions).
	The customizations are as follows:
	
	- if the subdirectory contains an executable sub_test script,
	that script will be used to run the tests in that directory
	rather than the default sub_test script (located in this
	directory).  A sub_test script may take whatever actions it
	wants, and is simply expected to generate any errors using
	the "[Error ...]" format so that it will show up in the
	summary.  Similarly, the script should generate any warnings
	or successful tests using "[Warning ...]" "[Success ...]"
	messages for consistency.  The sub_test script will be
	sent two arguments: (1) the compiler to use, and (2) the
	location of this main test/ directory.  The compiler and
	execution options will be stored in environment variables
	named COMPOPTS and EXECOPTS, respectively.
	
	- if the subdirectory contains a NOTEST file, that directory
	will not be considered for testing.  This can be useful for
	disabling subdirectories containing tests that don't work
	yet, or subdirectories that contain input files for other
	tests (though they will also be ignored if they fail to
	contain any .chpl files...)
	
	- if the subdirectory contains a COMPOPTS or EXECOPTS file,
	the options listed in that file will be added to the compiler
	and execution options for that subdirectory.  NOTE: be sure
	not to end the file with a linefeed -- it should simply be a
	list of options on the first line, followed <eof>.
	
	- if the subdirectory contains a CATFILES file, then the files
	listed in that file will be concatenated to the end of the
	compiler/execution output for each test.  For tests that
	generate files (either as a result of the compilation or
	as part of the executable's behavior), this can be used to
	ensure that the generated file's contents are correct without
	writing a specialized sub_test script.  Again, this file should
	be a single line with no linefeeds.
	
	- if the subdirectory contains a TIMEOUT file, then that file
	will be read to determine the number of seconds that the tests
	in the directory should be allowed to run before being killed.
	The default is currently 5 minutes.
	
	- subdirectory-specific .cvsignore files can also be very
	helpful so that files generated during testing won't clutter
	the results of a cvs -nq update command.
	
	Also worth describing here is the start_clean script which walks
	the directory structure in a similar manner and cleans up --
	removing the generated executables, core files, and *.tmp files
	which store any mismatching output.  The user can also specify
	subdirectory-specific things to clean up usinng a CLEANFILES
	file that lists other targets to remove (called with the -rf
	flag, so subdirectories will work here as well).  The idea is
	that after start_clean runs, the testing system should be left
	in a state pretty close to what's checked into the CVS tree.
	
	Again, to see a sample run of the testing system, look through
	the Samples/ directory, then run:
	
	./start_test -startdir Samples
	
	and inspect the Samples/ and Logs/ subdirectories to see what
	was generated.  Then use:
	
	./start_clean -startdir Samples
	
	to clean back up again.

Log message:
	Learned that the time to build on an NFS-mounted directory was
	painfully slow (10x slowdown for some commands), so added the
	option to set an environment variable CHPLDEVTMP which, when
	set, gives a root directory for writing .o's, .a's, and
	executables.  For example, on lotus, I set CHPLDEVTMP
	to /ptmp.  When compiling, rather than creating linux/
	subdirectories in the various directories, the Makefiles
	create a directory /ptmp/chapel-bradc/, mirror my source tree's
	structure under that point, and then sets up symbolic links
	to these directories for my linux/ subdirectories.  If CHPLDEVTMP
	is not set, things behave as they previously did.
	
	Well, almost... Two other changes made by this check-in:
	
	1) binaries are now built in the platform-specific subdirectories
	first.  Thus, your link line will look something like:
	
	g++ -o linux/chpl foo.o boo.o goo.o ...
	
	Then, a symbolic link to the binary is set up in the directory
	you're working in.  (Could switch this to a copy if anyone
	prefers).
	
	2) I defined the rule for how to build or build&link a platform-
	specific subdirectory in the make/Makefile.base file, included
	by all our other Makefiles, so added a rule prior to it:
	
	default: all
	
	so that when make is typed in any of these directories, you
	get the same behavior as before (previously, the first target
	in each of our Makefiles was "all").  One effect this has is
	that if you're hacking on a local Makefile and insert a rule
	before all, thinking that it will be the default, you'll be
	wrong (unless you also put it before the include Makefile.base).

Log message:
	This is a big checkin.
	
	1. Added graphing of internal data structures.
	2. Added interprocedural constant propogation
	3. The HTML dump and graphing show reaching interprocedural constants.
	Currently I am not limiting these... when the overhead get's too high
	I'll get around to writing the code to convert them into "some integer"
	which is already supported.
	4. Changed the way assignment works so that SSU form is useful (I was using
	references for all assignment).
	5. Added support for "inout" parameters, currently used for the
	(overloaded) make-reference operator.  This is indicated by
	putting a 'var' before the parameter.
	6. Added some support for 'const' to the Chapel grammar.  Now the AST is
	decorated with 'constness'.
	7. Added 'let' to the Chapel grammar.  This permits simple bindings instead
	of just non-SSA 'var' style bindings.  We can remove this if everyone
	hates it, but it is useful for testing.
	
	Graphing
	
	-G turns on graphing, graphs are put in the log directory
	two formats are supported, VCG and GraphViz.
	
	VCG is interactive, and let's you collapse and limit the
	graph dynamically.  It is described and the source code
	is available at:
	
	http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/users/sander/html/gsvcg1.html
	
	GraphViz is static, but it produces somewhat more pleasing
	files and outputs to postscript (amoung other formats).
	
	It is described and the source code is available at:
	
	http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/
	
	The output defaults to VCG, GraphViz is supported
	by --graphviz.
	
	Currently you can output the AST, the CFG, the SSU graph and
	the flow variables.

03/24/04 12:59:18 -- bradc

Log message:
	This checkin adds some crufty support for some trivial code
	generation (disabled by default), but lays in support for
	creating that source in a temporary directory, runtime
	libraries to support the source, compiling the source against
	the runtime libraries and moving the resulting binary back to
	the current working directory.  So consider it more infrastructure
	than any true support for code generation.
	
	Added new files to the compiler sources:
	codegen.cpp : the seat of code generation, currently
	files.cpp : utilities related to the tmp directory, int. files
	mysystem.cpp : wrapper around system() for issuing subcommands
	stringutil.cpp : some simple string utilities
	
	Notes:
	
	1) The tmp directory used for intermediates is stored in
	/tmp/chpl-deleteme.<pid>, where <pid> is the process ID
	of the compiler.  It currently isn't removed when compiles
	fail (fail, show_error, INT_ERROR, etc.) because I have
	a nasty fear of blowing away John's root directory again.
	After gaining some confidence with this, it should be
	blown away in these cases as well.  For the time being,
	if you're messing with code generation, you may want to
	monitor your /tmp directory and clean up by hand.  (Note
	that since codegen is currently disabled, you won't get
	these at all unless you take pains to enable them).
	
	2) Added some support for "internal errors" in misc.h/cpp via
	the macro INT_FATAL(ast, format, ...), which takes an
	AST* (or NULL if no obvious AST* is related), a printf-style
	format string, and the supporting args.  This prints out
	where in the compiler source the internal failure occurred,
	the argument message, and the source location that the AST
	corresponds to.  These are perhaps redundant with assert(),
	but I've never been a big fan of assert() (hard to set
	breakpoints on).  I'm open to persuasion for other approaches
	or modifications to this one.
	
	3) mysystem() (defined in mysystem.cpp) is currently simply a
	wrapper around C's system() to handle return codes, print
	out messages to the user, etc.  Eventually, it'll also
	print out the commands it's executing given an appropriate
	flag once I get around to adding some flag.
	
	4) Currently the binary is always named a.out.  Something else
	I need to add a flag for.
	
	5) stringutil.cpp contains a routine called glomstrings() that
	takes the number of strings and a varags list of char*
	pointers, mallocs the right amount of buffer space for
	them, glomst them all together, and returns the new string.
	Useful for building filenames and commands for mysystem().
	
	6) Factored the platform-decision stuff out of make/Makefile.base
	in order to use it in building the generated sources as well.
	
	7) The runtime directory structure is currently organized:
	
	chapel/
	runtime/
	etc/ -- Makefiles and such for building generated code
	include/ -- header files for generated code/runtime libs
	src/ -- source code for runtime libs

03/25/04 10:46:20 -- bradc

Log message:
	This checkin adds some flags to help control the compilation
	process (1).  It also adds some better error messages when flags
	are used improperly (2). Inserted some tests to protect these
	error messages (3) and added a new (minor) test feature (4).
	I also hoisted some code out of the geysa.h file into more specific
	header files (5).
	
	(1) The new flags are:
	
	-o --output <exename> : specify the name of the final binary
	--savec  <dir>    : save the intermediate C in the specified dir
	--print-commands  : print the system() commands executed
	
	(2) The changes to how flags are handled are:
	
	* if a flag that requires an argument isn't followed by an argument,
	an appropriate error message is printed out.
	
	* if an unrecognized flag is encountered, an appropriate error message
	is printed out.
	
	* if the copyright flag is used, the usage() information isn't printed
	
	(3) The first tests!  I put these in a directory called compflags/ to
	test compiler options.  I also added a DIRS file to the root test
	directory to serve as a guide to the directories and what their
	intention is.
	
	(4) The new feature in the testing system is support for a
	LASTCOMPOPTS file, similar to the COMPOPTS file, but which
	follows the source filename argument.  Thus, the most
	general compile line will be:
	
	chpl <-compopts> <COMPOPTS> source.chpl <LASTCOMPOPTS>
	
	(5) The code hoisted out of geysa.h is as follows:
	
	chplalloc.h : memory allocation routines

Log message:
	Incidental changes.  Did some work in starting to make header files
	stand more independently so that if one wanted to write code using
	the "AST" type, they could #include "ast.h" without having to worry
	so much about what it depended on.  This is by no means complete,
	but will be a lazy-evaluation background task.
	
	Also found that "echo -n" didn't work by default on the Suns, which
	created illegal dependence files, so reworked the Makefiles so that
	platforms could define their own ECHO target for use with echo -n
	(lazily, I only changed those echo commands in Makefiles that actually
	use -n...)

Log message:
	Minor changes.  codegen is still off by default:
	
	1) fixed the generation of write() calls to use the type_info of its
	arguments in generating the routine name (previously it was
	hard-wired to integer64).
	
	2) changed the runtime library's write() implementation to take a
	format flag in expectation of this need down the road.
	
	3) added a clean_exit() routine to use in place of exit() that blows
	away the /tmp directory created by code generation (if it exists)
	and switched error routines over to using this routine.  Also
	added a catch of SIGINT that calls fail() and will similarly blow
	away the /tmp directory (should probably add more signals, but
	I'm too lazy to try and come up with a portable list of signals
	that we'd want to catch today.

Log message:
	Added dominator computation a la Tarjan
	Added loop recognition a la modified Sreedhar-Gao-Lee Algorithm
	Added simple inlining
	Added interprocedural constant propogation
	Added new graph types:
	loops (procudural loops)
	rec (interprocedural loops)
	dom (dominators)
	calls (call graph)
	Added frequency estimation based on loop analysis
	Added the ability to annotate the graphs with frequency estimates.
	
	You may be wondering why I did procedural loop analysis instead
	of using the AST.  Well, in addition to being able to recognize
	loops constructed from goto and the like, I needed to do interprocedural
	loop recognition to handle recursion, and it is the same algorithm.

	SSU conversion, the grammars, etc.

	from the compiler (and might need to be updated later if I
	got them wrong).
	
	Similarly, maybe some of these programs are illegal for one
	reason or another.  They reflect my current understanding
	of how one might program such things, so to the extent
	that they cause problems, we should discuss which should
	perhaps be illegal, result in compile errors, etc.

Log message:
	Found that the path to the javascript stuff in the HTML dump
	was still not working for compiler invocations like:
	
	compiler/chpl -t foo.chpl
	
	so took a pass at fixing it.  I've tested the following four
	variations and they all seem to be working:
	
	/users/.../chpl -t foo.chpl
	compiler/chpl -t foo.chpl
	chpl -t foo.chpl (where chpl is in cwd)
	./chpl -t foo.chpl

	Touched up support for seg faults slightly from my previous
	version which was laid in in a rush a week or two ago.
	
	In writing my conditional code, found what appears to be a bug
	with empty strings on linux -- when strlen is taken of their
	compile-time representation, it seg faults.  I assume that this
	is due to our storage of them as opposed to a bug in strlen,
	but filed this as a placeholder.  It seemed I could get around
	it by writing my own strlen that checked against NULL and the
	empty string before sending the string in to the real strlen(),

Log message:
	Improved dependences for *.g.d_parser.o files.  These are
	dependent on geysa.h and all the things that it includes,
	but this dependence wasn't reflected in the Makefiles due
	to the challenges in listing the dependences of a dynamically-
	generated source file.
	
	The approach I took was to run g++ -MM on geysa.h, fudging
	the output format so that it defines a Makefile variable
	giving all the include files it includes rather than
	generating a standard dependence rule (which would have
	had no effect since geysa.h would be considered up-to-date
	since there's no rule to rebuild it).  Then, by giving
	this variable name in the rule to build *.g.d_parser.o,
	it will be recompiled whenever the any of the component
	header files change.  This should take care of most of
	the recent cases where a "make clean" was required.  If
	you come across more (and can reproduce them), please
	let me know.

Log message:
	trivial/bradc/arrinit now produces (reasonably) correct types
	for domains and arrays.  There are some limitations, in particular
	domains initialized from sequences are not converted into domains.
	This will be corrected when the new function lookup code is implemented.
	
	Note: there are several new AST nodes.  These include
	AST_array_descriptor, AST_domain and AST_cross_product.
	
	Again, the implementation of these codes is incomplete pending the
	new function lookup code.  It is sufficient for the test cases
	but likely little else.  If you want a particular test case to work
	in the near term, tell me and I'll see if I can finess it.

Log message:
	Added support for easily running the chpl compiler
	within gdb via a --gdb flag.  This is designed for
	cases when you are working with a long set of compile
	line flags and suddenly want to run it within gdb:
	
	lotus% chpl --savec output --print-commands ../test/foo.chpl
	fail: seg fault
	
	Typically, to debug this, you'd have to run "gdb chpl"
	and then within gdb cut and paste your whole command-line
	into the run command:
	
	(gdb) run --savec output --print-commands ../test/foo.chpl
	
	With this change, you can now run your original
	command line again, adding --gdb to it somewhere:
	
	lotus% chpl --savec output --print-commands ../test/foo.chpl --gdb
	
	This will cause the chpl compiler to launch a gdb
	session with the arguments automatically set up to
	be those you included on the command line (except
	for any occurrences of the --gdb flag, of course).
	Thus, upon running the compiler, you'll be whisked
	into gdb, and upon getting a gdb prompt, you can
	simply type run:
	
	(gdb) run
	
	You can use the "show args" command to verify what
	the arguments being used are.  Obviously, you can
	override the arguments by hand simply by specifying
	them with the "run" command or using the "set args"
	command.
	
	The other benefit of debugging the compiler in this
	mode is that it will set up hooks for the "run" and
	"quit" commands such that any /tmp directories that
	the compiler creates during the debugging session
	will be deleted when the program is re-run or you
	quit out of gdb.
	
	All this work was developed under gdb v5.3.  If you
	have a different version and have conflicts with
	what's been done here, let me know and we can look
	into supporting your version.
	
	In making this change, some other changes occurred
	as well:
	
	* Changed all instances of exit() to clean_exit(),
	which cleans up the compiler state before exiting.
	exit() should not be used anywhere in the program
	(but I haven't yet gone so far as to #define it
	out in a header file yet).
	
	* Made our current argument parsing routines make
	copies of the arguments that they are working
	with because they are fairly destructive with
	them (and we want to pass them on to gdb in their
	original form).
	
	* Previously, catching of SEGV and INT signals
	was only done during codegen.  I switched this
	to cover the whole program because it seems
	right and because Chapel's temp directory may
	now get created earlier, due to the --gdb flag.
	
	* Added a test to see that the --gdb command
	causes gdb to be fired up.  In doing so, added
	a new capability to the testing system: a
	COMPSTDIN file can be added to a test directory
	to specify an input file to be piped in as stdin
	during the compile invocation.  As need warrants
	it, I can add a similar feature, EXECSTDIN, for
	the invocation of the executable.

Log message:
	Got some extremely initial support for code generating
	domains in.  It's fairly crufty and is hardwired to 1D
	domains in  several places, but it makes some simple
	1D domain declarations work correctly, and seems like
	a reasonable stopping place to synch into before the
	weekend.
	
	This change also involved some minor side changes:
	
	* Turned on debugging and a bunch of warning flags for
	the compilation of the runtime and compiler-generated
	sources -- eventually, we'll want a more interesting
	mechanism for turning these on and off (like a -g
	flag in the compiler at minimum), but it's a start.
	
	* Made the gcc commands issued by the compiler via its
	generated Makefile show up on the console when the
	--show-commands flag is used.

Log message:
	Added initial support for code generation of functions and
	inserted a few tests to pin down this behavior.
	
	In order to make this work, I had to generate function
	prototypes at the top of the code because (a) we
	currently generate functions in a nondeterministic
	order such that functions won't necessarily be defined
	in the generated code before their calls, even if the
	user's code has the definition before the use, and
	(b) the current language concept allows functions to be
	called before they're used, so even if code generation
	followed the user's code directly, a prototype could
	still be required.
	
	I made code generation create two new header files to
	support these prototypes -- one that gives the external
	interface for the .c file (foo.h) and a second that
	contains internal prototypes for the .c file -- ones
	that are only meant to be included by the .c file itself,
	and not external clients (foo-internal.h).
	
	A few other minor changes that are going in with this:
	
	* I'd been using my glomstrings() in a degenerate way to
	copy strings -- glomstrings(1, stringToCopy) -- I
	wrapped this in an explicit copystring() function to
	make the code more readable.
	
	* Updated the compiler/FILES file to mention the new
	datatype.c file that I added yesterday.

	Error reporting for typing has been completely overhauled.
	Errors are now reported in a manner compatible with gcc (and
	hence emacs compilation).  Errors are reported by location in
	the code and include a (configurable) call tree depth to help
	the user differentiate versions of generic calls.
	
	The testing system has been changed to do sub_clean before a
	run so as to cleanup from the last run (necessary since I am
	testing the error system and erroroneous compilations don't necessarily
	overwrite the previous tests files).

07/20/04 13:12:44 -- bradc

Log message:
	* added more operators to the scanner, parser, and Expr classes (&=,
	|=, ^=, <<, >>).
	
	* fixed op= operators so that the op is no longer dropped on the floor
	and implemented code generation and pretty-printing for them.
	Updated the protoast/mg tests appropriately.
	
	* refactored the "Type" field of Symbol's subclasses into Symbol.
	Currently all Symbols are assumed to have a type of some sort,
	though that type may be dtUnknown;
	
	* started implementing a type_info() method on the Expr classes which
	will return the Type of that expression.  Currently this only works
	for the most basic of expressions and dtUnknown is returned when we
	don't know.
	
	* continued special casing write/writeln statements by making them a
	subclass of FnCall.  Implemented codegen for them using the same
	runtime mechanisms as the boostrap AST.
	
	* set up code generation framework for the new AST -- opened files,
	set up init procedure, etc.  Codegen is not very implemented for the
	new AST, so it would be naive to expect it to work.  The
	--no-codegen flag is currently your friend (as is the fact that you
	still only get the new AST with the --newast flag).  When using
	--newast and --no-codegen, the code will pretty-print to the screen
	as before.  It's worth noting that currently, the way that the init
	procedure is generated is very naive -- all code is assumed to be in
	init, which is just plain wrong.
	
	* put a rule into the Makefile that generates an error when "return"
	is used in chapel.y, because it's a mistake that I often make
	(rather than assigning to $$), and it sometimes takes me far too
	long to realize why the parser has suddenly broken.
	
	* changed the generation of the emacs TAGS file to include new AST
	sources.

Log message:
	Broke code generation of variables into two steps: the
	C declaration of the variable, and the initialization
	of the variable.  This is in part because C's variable
	declarations still need to be at the top of the scope,
	and in part because not all legal Chapel initializations
	are legal C initializations (as a TODO, noted in stmt.cpp,
	those variables that could be handled using C declarations
	+ initializations could be handled in this way down the
	road...).  Also moved VarDefStmts in the global scope into
	the __init() procedure, and hoisted the definition of the
	variable into the generated internal header file.  Updated
	the protoast tests to reflect this change.

Log message:
	Some random stuff:
	
	* parenthesize all codegen'd binary expressions as a
	conservative way to get operator precedence correct
	for the time being.
	
	* implemented type_info() for UnOp
	
	* implemented some very simple and naive type inference
	for variables with initializers whose type is elided.
	This is a stop-gap until we get John's inference stuff
	hooked into the high-level AST.
	
	* these changes allow Shannon's tests to work correctly,
	so turned on the --newast flag in her directory and
	removed her preincrement/postincrement tests, as we
	don't have them in the current language spec (or
	front-end).
	
	* dropped in some .cvsignore files to ignore test-generated
	files in the lowlevelcg directory, and output/ directories
	in the trivial subdirectories (because I often test with
	--compopts "--savec output" so I can see the generated code
	that failed.

	simple 1D domains for the time being...
	
	* started adding some new methods to the Expr hierarchy, though
	didn't implement them for many subclasses:
	isComputable() -- indicates whether the expression's value
	is computable at runtime
	intVal() -- returns the computable value for integer
	expressions
	
	* added better support for INT_FATAL() macro -- can still send
	in an AST* as the first argument, but can also send in a Loc*
	(root-ish class from the new AST that defines a filename and
	linenumber), or leave off any location indicator (previously,
	lots of calls sent in NULL...).
	
	* renamed type_info() to typeInfo() in new AST stuff and did
	a little more implementation of it for
	
	* changed default stride expression for SimpleSeqExpr from a
	NullExpr to stride "1" in hopes of reducing special cases.
	
	* fixed up generation of types in variable declarations
	(Shannon, this was the note that I was referring to when
	we talked on Tuesday.  I couldn't hold off any longer, but
	it would be worth doing a diff between these two files to
	see waht I did and why -- look for your name in the old
	version of the file).

Log message:
	* The main change in this check-in is the implementation of
	code generation for enumerated types, including the ability
	to print them out.  This change involved the following three
	steps which are more general:
	
	* Moved generation of default format strings for write statements
	from WriteCall to Type hierarchy so that things like enums and
	arrays could generate appopriate formats.
	
	* Started implementing codegen for TypeDefStmt's, and put
	methods to the Type hierarchy to generate IO routines for
	that type.
	
	* Specialized the symbols stored by EnumType to be EnumSymbols
	rather than simply Symbols.
	
	* As a side issue, added codegen for cast expressions.
	
	* Added a simple test of declaring, assigning, and printing
	enumerated type variables, as well as checking their integer
	values.

Log message:
	A bunch of changes designed to get an initial 2D domain/array
	code through the compiler.  It's not quite there yet, but close
	and stable (and I'm getting distracted by other things, so time
	to check in):
	
	* added ability to query an Expr or Type's rank() (only
	partially implemented) -- the idea being that scalars are rank
	0 and arrays are whatever rank they are.  (There's some
	question about what an array of an array's rank should be, but
	we'll cross that bridge when we get there...)
	
	* Added basic implementations of typeInfo() and codegen() for
	ArrayRef expressions.
	
	* Improved typeInfo() for DomainExpr expressions
	
	* Added some basic codegen() for ForLoopStmt's
	
	* Improved the implementation of VarDefStmt's codegen() method.
	
	* Implemented codegenDefaultFormat() for arrays, since they
	want to generate strings for their element types, not the
	array as a whole.
	
	* Added some stuff to the runtime: float types, some basic array
	code, basic forall loop macros, 2D domains.  Lots of this stuff
	needs to be generalized and/or emitted on an as-needed basis,
	but it seemed easier to lay in some specific instantiations
	first and generalize later.

Log message:
	Thanks to John's refactoring of include files for generated
	source code yesterday, this change improves our Makefiles
	so that (I believe) dependences will be correct for all
	generated source.  The one caveat is that if the third-party
	code changes, I don't think it's guaranteed that generated
	sources will correctly recompile.  This seemed like a
	reasonable step to take given that the third-party stuff
	is reasonably static, but the moral would be, if you remake
	your third-party directory, you might want to do a make
	clean in the compiler directory to be absolutely safe.
	
	The general strategy is that dummy .cpp files were introduced
	that #include only the single header file that is included
	by each generated source file, our make depend step is run
	on the .cpp file, and the output is sed-ited to define a
	Makefile variable.  Dependences are then added for the .o
	files for the generated files based on these variables to
	get the dependences correct.  This is actually what we
	were doing previously with geysa.h, but with John's recent
	refactoring of headers, this logic needed to be reproduced
	for other files rather than geysa.h.
	
	Since this doesn't use any new Makefile technology, I don't
	expect this to cause any problems for people, but if it does
	(or if you find things aren't getting remade when they should),
	give a shout.

08/06/04 16:32:46 -- bradc

Log message:
	Implemented an AST traversal framework and a few tiny
	tests to convince myself that it was working at least
	a little bit.  The scheme is as follows:
	
	ILink is a superclass of all the new AST classes.  It
	would've been called "Link" except that John had already
	used that name.  The "I" stands for "inheritance-based"
	(because template-based would be the other way to do it,
	but I've been trying to avoid templates).
	
	The ILink class now supports a traverse() method which
	is meant to walk around things in a reasonably
	intelligent manner.  Call it on a statement, and it
	will traverse the components of that statement (Exprs,
	Symbols, Types), as well as the statements that follow
	it.  Call it on an Expr, Symbol, or Type, and it will
	do similarly.
	
	The traverse() method takes a single argument which is
	an instance of a subclass of the Traversal class
	(implemented in the new files traversal.h and traversal.cpp).
	The idea is that anyone who wants to write a traversal of
	the AST will subclass Traversal, implementing methods that
	implement the traversal they want to do.  The Traversal
	class is quite abstract and looks like this:
	
	class Traversal {
	public:
	bool exploreStmts;
	bool exploreExprs;
	bool exploreSymbols;
	bool exploreTypes;
	
	Traversal(void);
	
	virtual void preProcessStmt(Stmt* stmt);
	virtual void postProcessStmt(Stmt* stmt);
	virtual void preProcessExpr(Expr* expr);
	virtual void postProcessExpr(Expr* expr);
	virtual void preProcessSymbol(Symbol* sym);
	virtual void postProcessSymbol(Symbol* sym);
	virtual void preProcessType(Type* type);
	virtual void postProcessType(Type* type);
	};
	
	Note that the methods are not pure virtual, so
	that you don't have to define all of these methods.
	
	Each of the four main components of the AST
	(Stmt, Expr, Symbol, and Type) has two methods
	associated with it: one that processes the
	class before all the things it contains, and a
	second that processes it after all the things
	it contains.  Thus, one can initialize state in
	the "pre" method and analyze it in the "post"
	method, or simply use pre alone (or post alone),
	or ...
	
	The four booleans indicate whether or not to
	explore the components that make the thing up.
	By default they are all set to true.  For
	example, if you merely wanted to explore a list
	of statements without diving into all of their
	internals, you would set exploreStmts to false,
	which would cause the traversal to merely walk
	the statement list that you point it at.  If
	you wanted to dive into certain statement types
	(say "write()" statements) but not others, you
	could do that explicitly by making your pre-/post-
	ProcessStmt() calls traverse the arguments
	explicitly.  In simple traversals, these booleans
	will probably be set once in the constructor and
	never changed.  More complex ones could change
	them as they go, though the concept frightens me
	a bit.
	
	Note that the traversal may contain cycles that
	I haven't debugged yet.  I found a few, but haven't
	run traversals on all the codes that we've written
	(and obviously there are lots of codes we haven't
	written yet).  There's also a chance that it may
	iterate over things in a weird order or multiple
	times, though I think I've weeded out the most
	egregious examples of this.
	
	The files findUnknownTypes.cpp/h contain two
	sample traversals -- one simply prints statements
	as the traversal comes to them; the second is
	slightly more interesting -- it walks around
	looking for symbols of type dtUnknown and complains
	about them (eventually, this is intended to call
	down to the low-level stuff when it finds such
	symbols to ask it what their types should be and
	fix them up, but for now it just complains).  It
	also has a method that will print out expressions
	whose typeInfo() method returns dtUnknown, but
	that is currently commented out.
	
	Feel free to try out at your own peril -- I think
	you should get something interesting and useful,
	but perhaps not something perfect.  When I get
	back, I'll continue to make use of this and debug
	it in the process.

	should be generalized in the runtime -- in particular, the definition
	of array descriptors and their supporting routines for initialization
	and output -- but this is a start.
	
	* fixed codegen for octal literals -- we currently don't have a notion
	of octal literals in Chapel, so care has to be taken when generating
	such literals in our C code so that the C compiler doesn't interpret
	them as such.

Log message:
	Added a Tuple subclass to the Expr class hierarchy.  Currently,
	parenthesized, comma-separated expressions are stored as Tuples.
	Eventually, we'll want to relax the requirement that parenthesis
	be used to define a tuple, but I didn't do it this time around.
	
	Added the ability to format expressions fed to a write statement
	by supporting a 2-tuple argument format in which the first
	element of the tuple is a format string and the second element
	is the argument.  Thus:
	
	write(a, b, c);
	
	will write out the a, b, and c arguments using some reasonable
	default formatting.  If the user wanted to control this
	formatting better, they could use:
	
	write(("%.2d", a), b, ("%12.6f", c));
	
	which would format a as a %.2d integer, use the default formatting
	for b, and format c as a %12.6f float.  The formats are currently
	identical to those supported by C.  Note that if the argument
	expression (a or c in this example) is an array, the formatting
	is applied to every element in the array.

Log message:
	Improved the testing system so that the -valgrind flag uses
	valgrind not only to test the compiler, but also the generated
	binary (when one is created by the test).  This new feature
	may be suppressed for a particular subdirectory by adding a
	NOVGRBIN file to the directory in question, which will suppress
	the use of valgrind on the generated binary.  I added one of
	these files to John's lowlevelcg directory since valgrinding
	its binaries is not as important (and, since they use GC, it
	raises difficulties even if we did want to valgrind it).
	
	With this change, found a subtle bug in some of the I/O code
	for arrays that I had just checked in, and updated output
	to reflect the fix.

	collapse parts of the tree, list methods, jump to source code,
	etc.)  It's pretty sweet.  Let me know if you have any

Log message:
	Added a new common base class for all AST (Stmt, Expr, Symbol, Type)
	classes named "BaseAST".  Currently, this only has a single member
	variable, "astType" which is an enumerated type (defined in baseAST.h)
	indicating what class the class instance is.  This is designed to
	avoid the overhead of using the typeid() feature and to support switch
	statements over AST node types.
	
	Wrote a traversal routine that verifies that all classes have their
	enumeration set as expected and ran this over the current test tree
	to make sure I had set things up as intended, but then commented
	this traversal out for the check-in.  Eventually we may want to make
	this a flag or (better) support a passlist that can be specified
	dynamically to indicate what passes should be run for a particular
	test.

Log message:
	Made some improvements to the symboltable and symbols.
	
	In particular, I hadn't yet linked symbols back to their scope.
	Have now done so -- each Symbol has a "scope" link of type
	SymScope* (defined in symscope.h) which links back to the scope
	in which it was defined.  The most useful bits of information
	in this scope are:
	
	(1) its "type" an enumeration of type scopeType that indicates
	whether the scope is:
	
	SCOPE_INTRINSIC == builtins at the global level
	SCOPE_FILE      == defined at the file level
	SCOPE_PARAM     == a function's parameter scope
	SCOPE_FUNCTION  == a function's top-level scope
	SCOPE_LOCAL     == a local scope to a function (compound stmt)
	SCOPE_FORLOOP   == the scope for a for loop's indices
	
	There will be more scope types as we move forward (SCOPE_CLASS is
	notably absent currently...).
	
	(2) its "level" -- an integer indicating the depth of the scope.
	
	-1 == SCOPE_INTRINSIC
	0 == SCOPE_FILE
	>0 == some scope within the file
	
	Note that this numbering has changed by 1 in this checkin
	(SCOPE_INTRINSIC used to be 0).  For convenience, the
	SCOPE_INTRINSIC and SCOPE_FILE symbols are defined to be -1
	and 0, respectively.
	
	In this check-in, I also moved away from STL maps and strings
	to avoid problems with GC that I hadn't anticipated initially,
	but which has been on my TODO list since I had the realization
	one morning that I was probably causing problems in this
	respect.  I'm now using John's HashMap class instead.
