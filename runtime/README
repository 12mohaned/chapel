Chapel Runtime Directory Structure and Files
============================================

This directory contains the source code for Chapel's runtime library
routines.  Note that make-ing this directory will only build it for
the current (or inferred) values of $CHPL_COMM and $CHPL_THREADS.
Multiple versions of the runtime can coexist simultaneously, but each
must be explicitly built.

The directory structure of the runtime/ directory is as follows:

./
  Makefile          : Makefile for the runtime
  README            : this file
  comm-gasnet/      : source code for GASNet communication layer
  comm-none/        : source code for no communication layer (1 locale only)
  etc/              : Makefiles for compiler-generated code
  include/          : header files for the runtime
    tasks/          : header files for the runtime's tasking layers
    threads/        : header files for the runtime's threading layers
  make/             : Makefiles for the runtime sources
  src/              : source code for the runtime
    tasks/          : source code for the runtime's tasking layers
    threads/        : source code for the runtime's threading layers
