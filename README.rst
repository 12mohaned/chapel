The Chapel Language
===================

Chapel is an emerging programming language designed for productive parallel
computing at scale. Chapel's design and implementation have been undertaken
with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and
laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end
supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are
being led by `Cray Inc.`_ in collaboration with academia, computing centers,
and industry. See `chapel.cray.com`_ for more information.
