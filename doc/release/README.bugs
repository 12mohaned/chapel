Reporting Bugs for Chapel
=========================

The Chapel compiler is tested using a suite of 2750+ tests on a
nightly basis for ~10 platforms using ~6 C/C++ compilers and a variety
of compiler flag combinations.  While these tests help us make steady
progress in implementing the language, there are still many bugs in
our implementation, some known to us, others not.  If you encounter a
bug or problem using the Chapel compiler, please do not hesitate to
contact the Chapel development team at the following address:

  chapel_bugs@cray.com

Please include as much information as possible in your email.  For
example:

  * the behavior you are seeing
  * the version number of your Chapel compiler (chpl --version)
  * the platform(s) you are running on and their OS versions
  * the C/C++ compiler(s) you are using and their versions
  * the output of the $CHPL_HOME/util/printchplenv.pl script
  * the Chapel program that caused the problem (if possible)

A list of unimplemented features and known bugs can be found in
$CHPL_HOME/STATUS.  Feel free to check any unexpected behavior against
this file.  Even if you run into a known issue, we encourage you to
email us a bug report to make us aware that it's a problem for your
code.  We are more than happy to suggest workarounds and/or to
prioritize working on an issue that is impeding your progress.
