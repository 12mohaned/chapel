===================================
Compiling Using the Chapel Compiler
===================================

If you have set up your environment as described in the top-level
README file and built the compiler as described in README.building,
you should be able to see the Chapel compiler's help message using:

     chpl --help

This displays the compiler's command-line flags sorted by categories,
in four columns: (1) the flag, (2) the current or default value of the
flag, (3) the kind of argument it takes, (4) a brief description of
the flag.


-----------------
Most Useful Flags
-----------------

We note some of the most useful flags here:

     -o <filename> : specify the filename of the generated executable,
                     otherwise ./a.out is used by default

     --print-passes : print the compiler passes as they execute

     --print-commands : print the system commands that the compiler
                        executes

     --cg-chpl-lineno : causes certain runtime error messages to
                        provide better information about the source
                        line that caused the problem

     --ccflags <flags> : specify flags that should be used with the
                         back-end C compiler

     --gdb : run the compiler in a gdb debugging session (use "halt"
             to exit the session if "quit" ever fails you)

     --cg-cpp-lines : add #line directives to the generated C code
                      (supports some degree of breakpointing and
                      debugging the target executable within gdb)

     --savec <dir> : saves the generated C code in the specified
                     directory

     --print-code-size : prints some code size statistics about the
                         number of lexical tokens per line, as well as
                         the number of code, comment, and blank lines


----------
Flag Types
----------

The flag types as indicated by the help message are as follows:

  ->true  = takes no arguments and sets the flag to true
  ->false = takes no arguments and sets the flag to false
  toggle  = takes no arguments and toggles the flag's value
  path    = takes a path or filename argument
  int     = takes an integer argument
  incr    = increments an integer value
  string  = takes a string argument
  double  = takes a floating-point value
