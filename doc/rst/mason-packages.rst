Mason Packages
==============

Community-developed modules are available as Mason packages on the
`Mason registry <https://github.com/chapel-lang/mason-registry/>`_.
These packages can be downloaded and used through :ref:`Mason <readme-mason>`,
Chapel's package manager.

Browsing available packages is best done through the ``mason`` command line
tool, via ``mason search``. They can also be found by browsing the mason
registry repository.

For details on contributing a package to the mason registry, see the
documentation on :ref:`submitting a package <submit-a-package>`.

.. note::

    This document and processes for submitting a mason package are still
    under development and are subject to change in the future.
