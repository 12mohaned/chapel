=============================
Chapel Contributor Agreements
=============================

This directory contains Chapel's Apache 2.0 contributor license
agreements (CLAs).  We require these to be filled out before
contributing to the repository in order to help us maintain Chapel's
license terms.

There are two versions:

* [chapel-ccla.pdf](chapel-ccla.pdf): For corporations or other
  organizations in which one entity is responsible for granting the
  rights for other contributors.  This includes academic contributors
  who are working on Chapel as part of their job or funded research.

* [chapel-icla.pdf](chapel-icla.pdf) : For individual contributors.

Once completed, CLAs should be scanned as PDFs and mailed to
chapel<!---obfuscation>_admin<!---obfuscation>@<!---obfuscation>cray.com.
