Error Handling in Chapel

TODO:
  Add an example of a forall loop and how we would catch an error coming out of
  it.  The try label is not needed for this category of error, and if not
  handled by users, would halt

  reasons why try is placed onto statements


Abstract
--------

A proposal for how error handling should work in Chapel.


Rationale
---------

Chapel currently lacks a general strategy for errors. The standard library
currently primarily uses two approaches: `halt()` and optional `out` arguments
(`out error: sys err`, if argument provided, assumes user will handle it; else
call `halt()` ). Each of these approaches has serious drawbacks.

  * Halting the program is not appropriate in library code
  * The output argument approach only returns error codes and doesn't permit
    users to add new error codes or new types of errors.

A more general strategy is desired. A good strategy would support the ability
to write bulletproof code, ideally in a way that supports propagation of
errors, and also the ability to get useful messages when errors are not
handled.

Description
-----------

This error handling proposal is inspired by the Swift error handling strategy.
See

https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ErrorHandling.html



This strategy is appealing because it represents a middle ground arguably
acceptable to devotees of both exceptions and error codes; it is easier to
implement than stack-unwinding since it re-uses the existing return mechanisms;
and it fits well with existing task parallelism.

Summary of the Swift Error Handling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Functions that can raise an error are declared with throws:

::

  func canThrowErrors() throws { … }
  func cannotThrowErrors() { … }

Calls that throw must be decorated with `try` or `try!`

`try` propagates the error to an enclosing `do`/`catch` block or out of a
throwing function `try!` halts if an error occurred

Programs can respond to errors with `do`/`catch` statements:

::

  do {
    try canThrowErrors()
    try! canThrowErrors() // will halt on failure
  } catch {
    writeln("The first call failed!")
  }


Why Decorate Statements That Throw
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Swift error handling approach includes the use of `try` to mark statements
that can throw. This design addresses the most serious criticism of exceptions
as a language feature - that they make the control flow possibilities hard to
reason about. By marking each statement that can throw, the control flow
possibilities can again be reasoned about with local information only.

Expected Additions for Chapel
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Throwing errors from iterators
* Ability to catch errors generated in runtime layers:

  * Communication
  * Memory allocation
  * Task creation
  * Not mandatory to check for these

* Task joins propagate errors to parent tasks:

  * Occurs at end the of sync/coforall/cobegin blocks


Examples
--------

Ex 1. Simple Errors

As an example, this is a function currently (Jan 2016) on our Timer record in
the standard modules:

.. code-block:: chapel

    proc start() : void {
      if !running {
        running = true;
        time    = chpl_now_timevalue();
      } else {
        halt("start called on a timer that has not been stopped");
      }
    }

It calls `halt` when the timer is already running, which is not very friendly.
With our proposal this would instead be:

.. code-block:: chapel

    proc start() throws : void {
      if !running {
        running = true;
        time    = chpl_now_timevalue();
      } else {
        raise Error("start called on a timer that has not been stopped");
      }
    }

This function can now be used as follows:

.. code-block:: chapel

    var my_timer: Timer;
    try! my_timer.start();
    do {
      try my_timer.start();
    } catch e: Error {
      writeln(Error.message);
    }
    try! my_timer.start(); // Will halt the program!

Ex 2. File IO

A common place for errors is interactions with the filesystem, we currently
handle these with two strategies, out arguments and halting.

.. code-block:: chapel

  var err: syserr;
  var file = open("my_data.dat", error=err);
  if !err {
    var channel = file.writer(err);
    if !err {
      channel.write(1, 2, 4, 8, err);
      if err {
        halt("Failed to write out data");
      }
    } else {
      halt("Failed to open channel");
    }
  } else {
   halt("Failed to open file");
  }

.. code-block:: chapel

  do {
    var file = try open("my_data.dat");
    var channel = try file.writer(err);
    try channel.write(1, 2, 4, 8, err);
  } catch  e: IOError {
    halt(e.message());
  }

  // Equivalent to:

  var file = try! open("my_data.dat");
  var channel = try! file.writer(err);
  try! channel.write(1, 2, 4, 8, err);
