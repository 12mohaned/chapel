Chapel Documentation
====================

This directory contains Chapel's documentation in two forms:

``html/`` contains a web-rendered form of the documentation, which reflects
the online documentation hosted at `http://chapel.cray.com/docs`. This can be
viewed by pointing a web browser of your choice to ``html/index.html``.

``rst/`` contains the documentation in the form of reStructuredText (rst), a
markup language. This documentation can be viewed with a text editor of your
choice.
