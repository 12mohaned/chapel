=======================
Reporting Chapel Issues
=======================

`GitHub Issues`_ are used to track public bug reports and feature requests for
Chapel.

Private issues should be reported to chapel_bugs@cray.com.
See the :ref:`private issues <readme-privatebugs>` page for more details.



Public issues that predate our issue tracker can be found on the (retired)
`chapel-bugs mailing list archives`_ and ``$CHPL_HOME/STATUS`` file for bug
reports that predate the usage of GitHub Issues.

Futures
-------

Futures are tests in the code repository used by the Chapel team to track bugs
and feature requests.

If you are a Chapel contributor and are familiar with the
`Chapel Testing System`_, you are encouraged to submit
`future tests`_ in conjunction with your issues.
