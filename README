Chapel Compiler Release: top-level README
=========================================

This is a preliminary release of the Chapel compiler, intended for
release to a small audience for evaluation and feedback purposes.  
See the LICENSE file for information about legal usage, and please
also keep in mind any informal discussions you've had with the
Chapel team about intended use of this release.


---------------------------
Setting up your environment
---------------------------

To get started, there are three environment settings that you should
make in order to use this release effectively:

1) Set the CHPLHOME environment variable to point to the location of
   the chapel/ directory in which this README is contained.  For
   example:

        setenv CHPLHOME ~/chapel

2) Set the CHPL_PLATFORM environment variable to the string returned
   by the $CHPLHOME/util/platform script.  For example:

        setenv CHPL_PLATFORM `$CHPLHOME/util/platform`

   Note: Chapel's currently supported platforms include 32- and 64-bit
   Linux, Cygwin, SunOS, and Mac OS X.  Other UNIX-based environments
   ought to work conceptually, but may not be supported by our current
   Makefile structure.  For help getting such details sorted out,
   please contact us at: chapel_info@cray.com

3) Set your path to include the directory $CHPLHOME/bin/$CHPL_PLATFORM
   which will be created when you build the compiler.  For example:

        set path = ($path $CHPLHOME/bin/$CHPL_PLATFORM)

The directory $CHPLHOME/etc/dotFiles contains sample lines for
inclusion in a shell's resource file to set these values.  They
require modification in order to specify the location of your
installation.
