Chapel Compiler Release: top-level README
=========================================

This is a preliminary release of the Chapel compiler, intended for
release to a small audience for evaluation and feedback purposes.  
See the LICENSE file for information about legal usage, and please
also keep in mind any informal discussions you've had with the
Chapel team about intended use of this release.





-----------
Quick Start
-----------

1) Change directories to the Chapel installation:

     cd $CHPL_HOME

2) Build the compiler and runtime libraries using:

     gmake

3) Set up your environment for using Chapel.  If you use a
   csh-compatible shell (e.g., csh, tcsh), use:

     source util/setchplenv.csh

   If you use a sh-compatible user (e.g., sh, bash), use:

     . util/setchplenv.bash

   If you use another shell, refer to doc/README.chplenv for
   information on what needs to be set up in your environment to use
   Chapel satisfactorily.

4) Compile an example program using:

     chpl -o hello examples/hello.chpl

5) Execute the resulting executable:

     ./hello
