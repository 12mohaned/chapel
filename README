Chapel Compiler Release: top-level README
=========================================

This is a preliminary release of the Chapel compiler, intended for
release to a small audience for evaluation and feedback purposes.  
See the LICENSE file for information about legal usage, and please
also keep in mind any informal discussions you've had with the
Chapel team about intended use of this release.



-----------
Quick Start
-----------

1) Make sure that your shell is in the directory containing this
   README file.  For example:

        cd ~/chapel

2) Build the compiler and runtime libraries using:

        gmake

3) Set up your environment to use Chapel.

   If you use...                                  then type...

     ...a csh-compatible shell (csh, tcsh)        source util/setchplenv.csh
     ...a bash-compatible shell (bash)            source util/setchplenv.bash
     ...the Bourne shell (sh)                     . util/setchplenv.sh

   You should still be in the "chapel" directory in order for these
   shell command scripts to work.

   If you use a different shell, refer to doc/README.chplenv for
   information on what needs to be set up in your environment to use
   Chapel satisfactorily (and if you're able to create an equivalent
   setchplenv script for your shell, please mail a copy of it to us at
   chapel_info@cray.com for inclusion in our next release).

4) Compile an example program using:

        chpl -o hello examples/hello.chpl

5) Execute the resulting executable:

        ./hello
