Goals 
-----
The goals of this release are as follows:

* to demonstrate Chapel features in a multi-threaded, single-locale
  (single-node or shared-memory) setting

* to give HPCS mission partners and other interested parties an
  opportunity to see the state and evolution of the Chapel
  implementation first-hand

* to get feedback on the Chapel language and its ongoing
  implementation


--------------
User Agreement
--------------

Users of this release agree to the following statements:

* I agree not to make the release URL, its contents, or my account
  available to others.  Instead, I will direct such parties to
  chapel_info@cray.com.

* I understand that this release is being made available to me in
  order to give me an early peek at Chapel.  I understand that the
  implementation effort to date has focused primarily on demonstrating
  Chapel's features and that the performance and memory utilization of
  the current implementation are not likely to be indicative of what a
  more mature Chapel compiler would be capable of.

* In making any public comments characterizing Chapel on the basis of
  my access to the release, I agree to be mindful of its preliminary
  nature.

* For any publications or talks about Chapel whose content is based on
  my experiences with the release, I agree to run the material past
  the Chapel team for comments and feedback prior to making it
  publicly available.

* I agree not to disclose performance/memory results for Chapel
  without first obtaining permission from the Chapel team.
