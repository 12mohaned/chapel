Fixed a number of issues related to byte-ordering that
were causing failures on the Suns:

- when I switched the 'f'/'F' flags from int to bool,
  I switched the command-line parsing of them, but
  failed to switch the environment variable parsing,
  such that environment variables (like CHPL_DEVELOPER)
  weren't necessarily working correctly on Suns.

- switched a use of _chpl_tostring_integer from using
  "%d" as its output format to _default_write_integer64
  which should be more portable and immune to byte
  ordering.

- fixed _chpl_tostring_complex to not rely on byte
  ordering of the .re and .im fields in the complex
  value by accessing them directly.

- switched formatting strings in test_format_primitives
  to use %lld rather than %d for now since we don't
  do our own Chapel-oriented parsing of formatting
  strings yet.  This is consistent with other tests, if
  unfortunate.
