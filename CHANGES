version 0.5
-----------
Second preliminary release of Chapel Compiler, June 2007

High-Level Themes:
- single-locale, multiple threads
- support for additional serial features
- improved single-threaded performance, memory utilization
- improved multi-threaded correctness
- target audience: HPLS evaluation team, HPCS mission partners, 
  select HPC users and centers

Changes to Chapel Language:
- eliminated sequences
  - in the future, a standard List library will provide similar functionality
  - removed # and #= operators, since they were supported for sequences
  - removed support for sequence literals; use tuples in their place
    e.g., var A: [1..3] real = (0.1, 2.3, 4.5);
  - removed support for casting sequences to tuples and tuples to sequences
  - iterators in an expression context now result in a 1D, 1-based array
    e.g., "iterator foo() { ... }  var A = foo();" creates a 1D array over [1..]
- added "range" type to language to replace old "arithmetic sequence" concept
  e.g., "lo..hi" or "lo..hi by str" are ranges
  - open interval syntax supported for ranges
    e.g., "[lo..hi)" is equivalent to lo..hi-1
  - +, -, *, / operators on range/scalar combinations
- added support for creating array aliases
  e.g., "var Amid => A[2..n-1, 2..n-1];" creates an alias, Amid, to the slice
- support for standard math, bitwise, and comparison operators for tuples
  e.g., "(i,j) + (1,-1)" yields "(i+1, j-1)"
- swap operator: <=>
  e.g., "a <=> b" is semantically equivalent to "const t = b; b = a; a = t;"
- better support for writing output
  - enabled strings to be written to using a write() method
    e.g., var s: string;  s.write("x is: ", x);
  - added a Writer class that enables user classes to be written to
  - writeThis() methods that define how a type should be written to a Writer
- added minloc and maxloc reductions that return min/max value and index
  e.g., var (minVal, minInd) = minloc reduce (A, A.domain);
- changed arithmetic domain range access from D(<dim#>) to D.dim(<dim#>)
  e.g., var rows = D.dim(1);
- arithmetic domains and arrays support low and high methods that return bounds
  e.g., var loInd = A.low;
- support for range, domain, and array slicing via bounded or unbounded ranges
  e.g., "A[2.., ..n]" is equivalent to "A[2..A.dim(1).high, A.dim(2).low..n]"
- support for promoting casts across array elements
  e.g., var x: [1..4] real, y: [1..4] int;  y = x:int;
- added support for param functions that support compile-time evaluation
  e.g., "def square(param x) param { return x**2; }  param n2 = square(14);"
- support for default values for param members of classes
  e.g., class C { param bitWidth = 32; ... }
- support for functions without parentheses
  e.g., def f { writeln("In function f"); }
  - allow "main" function to be declared with or without parentheses
    e.g., def main { writeln("Program will start here"); ... }
- allow "<index> in" to be elided in for/forall loops/expressions
  e.g., "for 1..n { ... }", "var A = [1..n] 0.0;"
- support for multiple modules to be listed within a single "use" statement

Newly Implemented Features:
- support for sparse domains/arrays
  - assignment of aggregate index expressions to sparse domains
  - accumulation of indices into sparse domains using +=
- added support for partially and fully unbounded ranges ("lo..", "..hi", "..")
- enumerated domains and arrays
- support for nested classes, records, and iterators
- serial statement
- added support for using "_" to ignore elements during tuple destructuring
  e.g., var t: (int, real) = ...;   (t1, _) = t;
- added support for nested tuple destructuring in variable decls/formal args
- support for config params of primitive and enumerated types
- initial support for accessing a module's member via modname.membername
- implemented dynamic casts between class types
- added initial support for copy collection garbage collection
- subdomain keyword is now supported, though subset relationship is not checked
- initial support for specifying a distribution class; interface still in flux

Syntactic/Naming Changes:
- removed support for using "?" in identifiers
  - changed standard method member? to member
  - changed standard method true? to isTrue
- removed support for "--" as a single-line comment style
- an array's domain should now be accessed via A.domain rather than A.dom
- array element type identifier changed from elt_type to eltType

Semantic Changes:
- changed relative precedence of casts and unary +/- (unary +/- is now tighter)
  e.g., -2:uint(32) is equivalent to (-2):uint(32) rather than -(2:uint(32))
- removed support for structural iterator interface (getHeadCursor, etc.)
- added support for defining default iterators for classes and records
- initial support for querying parameters/types in a formal class argument
  - similar support for variable-length argument lists of generics
- where clauses can now compare against formal generic types
- short-circuiting operators only require isTrue rather than true? & false?
- in x op=y, a cast to x.type is used in assigning back to x if it is primitive
- compilerError() can now take multiple arguments like a halt()

Documentation:
