# Print the names of any third-party packages needed for the current

#
# ASSUMPTIONS:
# - This script is located in .../chapel/util/chplenv/third-party-pkgs
# - The format of the output from 'printchplenv' follows the current
#   conventions.  Specifically,
#   - Chapel-specific environment variables are prefixed with 'CHPL_' (***)
#   - Any Chapel environment variable ending in '_PLATFORM' describes
#     the hardware/OS combo and will not considered in this script
#   - "Top-level" Chapel environment variables are printed starting
#     in the first column.  Any Chapel environment variables that 
#     indented are assumed to be modifiers of the corresponding top-level
#     variable and will not be considered in this script (*** and also
#     do not necessarily have to be prefixed with 'CHPL_')
