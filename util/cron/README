Other notes
===========

start_opt_test
--------------

Currently unused - in part because there were always holes and there
wasn't a good diffing system as with the normal nightly runs. So
sifting through logs to see what was changing required a lot of
human effort. We keep it around in hopes of resurrecting it.
