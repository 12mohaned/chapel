**A Note on Mis-Attributions**
<a name="footnote"></a>

\* = Note that due to a conversion mistake when moving our source
    repository from SVN/SourceForge to Git/GitHub, some past
    contributors' names were mapped to an incorrect name in the Git
    repository.  These mistakes have been annotated in the repository
    itself via git-notes indicating the "Actual Commit Author."  For all
    intents and purposes, any:

| commits attributed to...   | should actually be attributed to... |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ...Jeff Lewis              | ...John Lewis                       |
| ...Preston Pfarner         | ...Preston Briggs                   |
