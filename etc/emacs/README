=================
Chapel emacs mode
=================

This directory subtree contains emacs e-lisp files that perform simple
formatting of Chapel code.  Support for Chapel formatting with these
files is far from perfect, but also far better than having no
formatting at all.  Versions 22.0/22.1 are the main version that we
are currently supporting -- the earlier versions are somewhat stale
and likely to only get staler over time.  Thanks to Steve Balensiefer
for providing the initial version of the Chapel mode for these
versions.

The sources in this subdirectory are licensed under the GPL.  See the
COPYING file in this directory for more information.

To use these modes, it is suggested that you install these directories
so that they appear under your Chapel release as follows:

   $CHPL_HOME/    -- the location of your normal Chapel installation
     etc/         -- the result of un-tarring chapel-editors.tar.gz
       emacs/     -- this directory

In which case, you should be able to use these modes by adding the
following lines to your standard .emacs file:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

; query the environment variable CHPL_HOME
(setq chpl-home (getenv "CHPL_HOME"))

; prepend $CHPL_HOME/etc/emacs/x.y to your emacs load-path where x.y
; is your emacs version number
(if (string= chpl-home nil)
    nil
  (setq load-path (cons (concat chpl-home
                                "/etc/emacs/"
                                (number-to-string emacs-major-version) 
                                "."
                                (number-to-string emacs-minor-version))
                        load-path))
  )

; make sure that when chpl-mode is entered, (our modified) cc-mode is
; loaded
(autoload 'chpl-mode "chpl-mode" "Chpl enhanced cc-mode" t)

; make loading files with a .chpl extension put emacs into chpl-mode
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.chpl$" . chpl-mode)
                            auto-mode-alist))
