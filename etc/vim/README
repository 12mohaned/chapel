    $ mkdir $HOME/.vim

  - Copy the contents of this directory to your ".vim" directory

    $ cp -r * $HOME/.vim


Enabling Chapel Features in Vim:
-------------------------------

Vim commands are denoted ": command".  Any of these commands can be issued
automatically by adding them to your ".vimrc" file.

  - Enable automatic filetype detection:

    : ftdetect on
  
    Alternatively, you can manually select the chapel file type:

    : set filetype=chpl

  - Enable syntax highlighting scheme:
  
    : syntax on

  - Enable indenting scheme:

    : ftdetect indent on

    
Suggested .vimrc commands (can be copy-pasted into ~/.vimrc):
------------------------------------------------------------

set nocompatible    " allow for non-vi compatible features
syntax on           " enable syntax highlighting
filetype indent on  " turn on filetype detection and indenting
set autoindent      " turn on auto indenting

" If you prefer spaces to tabs, uncomment the following:

" set expandtab     " replace indents with spaces
" set shiftwidth=2  " set how many spaces per indent
" set smarttab      " use spaces as indents at the beginning of lines
