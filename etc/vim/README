Installation Instructions:
=========================

  - Create a directory in the root of your home directory called ".vim"

    $ mkdir $HOME/.vim

  - Copy the contents of this directory to your ".vim" directory

    $ cp -r * $HOME/.vim

  - (optional) Create a vimrc configuration file containing the settings given
    below.

    $ vim $HOME/.vimrc


Enabling Chapel Support in Vim:
==============================

Vim commands are denoted ": command".  You can give these commands manually
whenever you open a file or they can also be given automatically every time vim
is started by putting them in your ".vimrc" file.

  - Enable automatic filetype detection:

    : filetype on
  
    Alternatively, you can manually select the chapel file type:

    : set filetype=chpl

  - Enable syntax highlighting scheme:
  
    : syntax on

  - Enable indenting scheme:

    : filetype indent on

    
Suggested .vimrc commands (copy-paste these into your .vimrc):
=============================================================

set nocompatible    " allow for non-vi compatible features
syntax on           " enable syntax highlighting
filetype indent on  " turn on filetype detection and indenting
set autoindent      " turn on auto indenting

" If you prefer spaces to tabs, uncomment the following:
"  (To get a real tab with these settings, do CTRL-V TAB)
" set expandtab       " replace indents with spaces
" set shiftwidth=2    " set how many spaces per indent
" set smarttab        " use spaces as indents at the beginning of lines

" Other useful commands, uncomment as desired:
" set background=dark " switch to color scheme for terminals with a dark background
" set ignorecase      " ignore case when searching (turn off by ": set noignorecase")
" set incsearch       " enable incremental search
" set ruler           " show cursor line at the bottom of the terminal
" set showmatch       " show bracket matches
" set showmode        " display current mode in the status line
