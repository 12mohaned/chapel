Chapel editor support
=====================

This directory contains rudimentary support for code
coloring/formatting in emacs and/or vim.  It is intended to be
unpacked just under your $CHPL_HOME directory as follows:

$CHPL_HOME/     -- the location of your normal Chapel installation
  etc/          -- the result of un-tarring a chapel-<editor>.tar.gz file
    README      -- this file
    emacs/      -- the result of un-tarring chapel-emacs.tar.gz
    vim/        -- the result of un-tarring chapel-vim.tar.gz

Both the emacs and vim modes for Chapel were created by modifying
existing language formatting modes for each editor, and are therefore
licensed under the agreements of those languages (i.e., GPL for emacs
and VIM license for vim).  See the license files in the emacs/ and
vim/ subdirectories for details.
