Chapel editor support
=====================

This directory contains rudimentary support for code
coloring/formatting in emacs and/or vim.  It is intended to be
overlaid on top of your $CHPL_HOME directory as follows:

$CHPL_HOME/     -- the location of your normal Chapel installation
  etc/          -- the result of un-tarring a chapel-<editor>.tar.gz file
    README      -- this file
    emacs/      -- the result of un-tarring chapel-emacs.tar.gz
    vim/        -- the result of un-tarring chapel-vim.tar.gz

Both the emacs and vim modes for Chapel were created by modifying
existing language formatting modes for the respective editors, and are
therefore licensed under the agreements of those languages (i.e., the
GPL for emacs and the VIM license for vim).  See the LICENSE files in
the emacs/ and vim/ subdirectories for details.
