Iterative flow analysis is a combined data flow and control flow analysis.
It is capable of resolving the concrete types (as opposed to the nominal
or declared types) for statically or dynamically typed programs.  It
is extensible and supports:

  - static or dynamically typed languages
  - function and imperative languages
  - dynamic dispatch (virtual functions)
  - multiple dispatch
  - first class functions and selectors
  - and many other features

Written in C++ using the Boehm garbage collector.
