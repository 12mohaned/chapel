- support applications with more than required arguments as multiple-calls
  (add_application_constraints)

- handle structural types.  Generalize tuple handling to include ref etc. in
  patterns.

- prototype Chapel grammar

- constant folding (now required earlier to do generics)
  + remove dead (folded) code 

- inlining

- handle david's generics stuff

- trailing context for regex to handle 1..n

- AST rewrite to change '=' to '==' in expressions and to
  make sure no other assignments are in expressions. (??)

- use inlining to simplify te program graph so that SSU conversion
  is more effective.

- differentiate abstract ATypes (which have a single CreationSet and no defs)
  from concrete ones

- do we need the power of the creation_point in add_var_constraints?

- move build_map and add_vars out of prim_make
  - handle ref variables
  - maybe in creation_point?  

- handle constants in vector_application

- do constant propgation in fa.cpp

- odd thing about vectors: #[1] is rank 0 (make sense)

- describe type hierarchy.  symbols < a symbol < functions with symbol as name
-               classes as a separate hierarchy tied into the object
                hierarchy

         ObjectClass
         / |
   Object  |
      |    |
      |  AClass
      | /  |
      A    |
      |    |
      |  BClass
      | /
      B

- make_top_edge should call with the appropriate arguments.
  - should store the top level pnode in the database (somewhere)

- generalize the "autoderef" charateristic of the "." operator
and the vector(xx) call.  Perhaps attach it as a property to the
function call? Alternatively, we could have two different calls...
but how to specify?  Some sort of hidden variable "autoderef = true",
or "is_lval = true"?

- fixup methods "self" and "super" variables to work correctly

- fixup clearing and collecting of variables and Pnodes... what 
  are the phi and phy lists for?

- remove lval and is_val

- add ast arg to if1_send

- remove duplicate type_violations by hashing av*pnode

- figure out why adding $right 5200 to 'new' causes problems

- remove "next_sym"

- optimize function dispatch
- deal with "class_static"

- document and do examples for functions returning lvals
