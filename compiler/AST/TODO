* try to get return of append working better
* and traversal of linked lists -- remove casting
* take all instances of NULL out
* move suspicious symbols into prelude file
* fix precedence problems (and there are lots)
* check necessity of print*() variants
* move char literals from chapel.y to chapel.lex
* deal with BLC comments

* Need to insert iterator indices into own scope (e.g., [i:D] i) rather
  than parent's
* Check for redefinition of symbol within same scope

* support for classes/methods

* subdomain/subindex expressions are wrong (idents rather than expressions)

* understand what can be used before defined better and handle more cleanly

* remove dead code (usually commented out)


for reductions:

* get rid of strcmp on reduction
* keep track of a level in the symboltable and check against that plus
  the "reduction" string?
* or define a reduction symboltable pointer?
