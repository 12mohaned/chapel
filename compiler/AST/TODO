* move suspicious symbols into prelude file
* unify char literals between chapel.y and chapel.lex (name or not)
* deal with BLC comments

* Need to insert iterator indices into own scope (e.g., [i:D] i) rather
  than parent's
* Check for redefinition of symbol within same scope

* support for classes/methods

* understand what can be used before defined better and handle more cleanly

* remove dead code (usually commented out)

* squelch init prototype
  - and/or specialize name of init procedure to file and make a top-level
    init file

* improve variable initialization for domains -- generalize for
  nontrivial initializations, and remove some of the typeid stuff
  by factoring into class hierarchy?

* remove hack that assumes domains of unknown rank are 1 (stmt.cpp
  and type.cpp) -- trivial/bradc/declprintdom2.chpl is an example

* remove reduce/reduce and scan/reduce conflicts

* should do export control of variables, types, all symbols

* organize and lump user files better -- into a static class, e.g.

* fix VarDefStmt::codegen() so that it asks the type whether it
  needs to be initialized and then asks the type to generate
  the arguments to the initialize method.

* unify IDENT tokens in the lexer/parser -- we're not going to
  be able to tell most of the time, so should minimize our
  reliance on them...

* add traversal that verifies that back pointers are non-nil.

* make codegen for unresolved symbol cause problem to ensure all
  symbols are resolved

* remove hacks that assume dtUnknown is an integer

* resolve question of whether or not resolving symbol in symtab.cpp
  for MemberAccess is a problem

* multifile compiles

* write forall for link.cpp?  Refactor link into a list class to allow
  pre-insertion?

* preludes as modules?  Figure this out.

* codegen standard libraries as a compiler invocation?

* make a built-in types class

* rename type symbols prior to codegen

* write symbol resolution pass


SHANNON:
* fix type_info() for BinOp
* implement isComputable() and intVal() better for Expr hierarchy
* add read routines for enumerated types?
