This file contains an up-to-date list of unimplemented features and
bugs in the compiler.  This list is not meant to be complete as the
language is still being defined.  In particular, missing functions
from the standard modules are not enumerated.

Variables and Types
===================

  * Variable declarations in a tuple
  * Non-ASCII strings
  * Functions to change strings to other primitive types
  * Configuration parameters
  * Values of non-bool type are allowed where only values of bool type
    should be allowed.

Modules
=======

  * The argv sequence
  * Accessing variables via explicit names, e.g., mod.x
  * Using modules not explicitly passed to the compiler

Functions
=========

  * Formal arguments in a tuple
  * Intents
  * Functions as variables and/or arguments to functions
  * Formal arguments of tuple type must match actual arguments
    exactly.

Classes, Records, and Unions
============================

  * Nested classes and records
  * Chained constructor calls for derived classes
  * Shadowing base class fields
  * Inheriting from multiple classes
  * Garbage collection
  * Anonymous record literals
  * Type select on unions
  * Assignment between classes and records

Tuples, Sequences, and Iterators
================================

  * Ignoring values via underscores
  * Implicit reductions in conditional, while, and select statements
  * The transpose, spread, and reshape functions
  * Indexing by indefinite arithmetic sequences
  * Zipper iteration bounds matching

Arrays and Domains
==================

  * Sparse arrays and domains
  * Opaque arrays and domains
  * Enumerated arrays and domains
  * Arrays of arrays
  * Index type bounds checking
  * Subdomains
  * Array promotion returns sequences.

Generics
========



Parallelism and Synchronization
===============================

  * Atomic statements
  * Serial statements
  * User-defined reductions and scans
  * Forall loops and ordered forall loops are serialized.
  * Reductions and scans are serialized.
  * Array and sequence operations and assignment are serialized.

Locality and Distributions
==========================

  * Locales
  * Distributions
