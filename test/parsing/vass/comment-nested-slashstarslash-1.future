bug: inside a comment, the sequence /*/ is considered a complete nested comment, rather then a start of a nested comment

Cf. when not inside a comment, /*/ opens a comment.
When inside a comment, then, /*/ should start a nested comment, too,
for consistency.

Right now I get:
  comment-nested-slashstarslash-1.chpl:5: error: should not see this one - 2

but instead should be getting "EOF in comment" since the sole */
on Line 4 should be closing the nested comment opened by /*/.
