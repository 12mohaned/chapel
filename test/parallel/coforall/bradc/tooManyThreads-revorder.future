feature request: more tasks

This is a test that demonstrates that it's possible to
create a reasonable number of executing threads (in the
sense that they don't bog down the CPU), but that the
code currently results in deadlock.  This could be fixed
either by:

- implementing a re-queueable task pool,
- by providing a task implementation mechanism/policy flag and using
  it to select "literally spawn a thread per task", or by
- making the default value of maxThreads reflect the maximum number
  of threads supported by the architecture.
