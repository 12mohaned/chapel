bug: simple read of "array of sync var" element doesn't empty

This is similar to the bug from simplereadSync.chpl except that the
fix that worked there doesn't seem to work for simplereadSync.chpl.

When this test is working, please let Brad know and/or update
studes/hpcc/common/bradc/hpccMultilocale.chpl to remove the
tmp variables used to empty sync vars.
