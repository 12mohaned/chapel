The error here is that internal routines are coercing the synchronizing
variable to its base type when they should be using the synchronizing
variable type itself.  A fix would be to mark internal functions with 
pragmas such that calls within them do not coerce their sync var arguments 
because:
 - the called function has been marked
 - or the calling function has been marked
