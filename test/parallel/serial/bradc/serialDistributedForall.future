bug: serial distributed forall loops are not serial

This test demonstrates that 'serial' is not currently serializing
forall loops that iterate over distributed domains/arrays.  My
hypothesis is that this is because of the optimization we have to
handle coforall + on loops with lower overhead.  We're probably
ignoring the serial state in this case...  Investigating now.
