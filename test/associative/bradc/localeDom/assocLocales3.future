bug: seemingly incorrect illegal instantiation with a generic type

If the function clearForIteratableAssign() is removed from the
SingleLocaleAssociative.chpl file, this test results in:

$CHPL_HOME/modules/standard/SingleLocaleAssociative.chpl:128: error:
illegal instantiation with a generic type [generics.cpp:316]

Tracing through it, it seems that the associative domain of locales is
being considered to be a generic type for some reason.  My intuition
is that it should not be.

Also of interest is that the simpler versions of this test --
assocLocales.chpl and assocLocales2.chpl work, so the issue is
something deeper than simply the use of an associative domain of
locales within a generic class.

Any help diagnosing this would be appreciated.
