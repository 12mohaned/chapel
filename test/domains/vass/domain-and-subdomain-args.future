bug: subdomain types for formals are not implemented

The compiler emits "error: 'chpl__buildDomainRuntimeType' undeclared (first use this function) [normalize.cpp:79]" while compiling each of testSubDomain() and testSparseSubDomain().

(I am not sure whether it'd be sufficient to define the function(s) the
compiler is trying to invoke, or if deeper changes are needed.)
