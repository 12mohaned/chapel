error message: iterator class error

  Currently, min is being promoted.  We could overload for ranges

  syntax if that generated a reasonable error message.


Should < be implemented on ranges?  What does min of multiple ranges mean?

domains, ranges

This test attempts to compare the two ranges of a 2D domain, D.
First there is a test to check if D(1) is equal to D(2).  Next, there
is an attempt to compute the min(D(1),D(2)).  Both do not compile.

The error for the equality test, which is encountered first:

test_compare_range.chpl:14: In function 'initMatrix':
test_compare_range.chpl:16: error: unresolved call ':range(int,bounded,0)._promotionType()'
