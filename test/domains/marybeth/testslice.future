Domains, slicing

This test performs slicing on a domain that has one dimension
that is an empty range.  Two slices on the empty range are tested:
..1 and 1.. .  The first results in the range 1..1 and the second
results in another empty range 1..0.  Shouldn't both result in an
empty range?

Another two slices are tested:  ..2 and 2...  The first results
in 1..2 and the second in 2..0.  I'm not sure how the
empty range should be represented for the first case - 1..0 or
2..0?
