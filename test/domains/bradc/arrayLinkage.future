semantic: domain sharing via .domain

This future asks the question whether declaring an array
using Arr.domain from another array should cause the
two arrays to share the domain, or whether the domain
should be logically copied in declaring the second
domain.  I don't currently have an opinion on this.
Currently, the two arrays are linked.  I guess the
question is whether the const-ness of Arr.domain suggests
that the two arrays should not be linked since the
second array's domain is "const".
