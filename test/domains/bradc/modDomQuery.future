unimplemented feature: domain queries are const

We recently decided to make modification of domains through a
query of the array illegal -- that domains can only be modified
by assigning to a domain variable directly.  As I recall, this
is partly to avoid confusion (e.g., why did modifying A's domain
also modify B and C?) and so that anonymous domains are const.
