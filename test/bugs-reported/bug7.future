unimplemented feature:	Support for Graph Data Structures and Concurrent Graph DS. 
		
Feature Addition:
	Graphs are important data structures, used in many data-intensive processing (like Data Mining Algorithms). 
	Supporting optimized Graph Data Structures in the Standard Library will really help the Chapel Users.
			
I am in the process of writing a simple Module supporting common Graph DS and Algorithms like BFS, DFS, MST Algorithms, etc.
