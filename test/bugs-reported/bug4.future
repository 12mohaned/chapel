bug: The List Module does not support accessing elements of a list based on index. I feel that this should be supported.

Explainations:
iv.a. (bug4.chpl)
			bug4.chpl:27: In function 'dequeue':
			bug4.chpl:34: error: unresolved access of 'list(int(64))' by '(int(64))'
 
		
		Bug Description:
			The List Module does not support accessing elements of a list based on index. I feel that this should be supported.
			 

		Explaination:
			I understand the list is implemented as a record, and the above syntax to access the list elements isn't correct, but I as a programmer would want to access elements of the list in some way using indices.
		
	iv.b. (bug4.chpl)
		If we change the access in line 34 to var data:int = underlying_list.these(front)
		
			bug5.chpl:27: In function 'dequeue':
			bug5.chpl:34: internal error: FUN3849 chpl Version 1.12.0.df10fc5

			Internal errors indicate a bug in the Chapel compiler ("It's us, not you"),
			and we're sorry for the hassle.  We would appreciate your reporting this bug -- 
			please see http://chapel.cray.com/bugs.html for instructions.  In the meantime,
			the filename + line number above may be useful in working around the issue.

		Bug Description:
			The List Module supports iterators on lists. I am able to iterate through the list (see displayQueue()) but accessing an index through this iterator leads to an internal error. 				I feel that this should yield the element at that index - if it is a valid index, else an IndexOutOfBounds exception.
