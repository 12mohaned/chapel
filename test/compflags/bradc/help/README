Whenever the output of --help changes from the user's
perspective, the userhelp.txt file must be updated to
reflect the new contents of the help message, minus
the two lines that reflect the compiler's version
number.  The best way to do this is to do:

         start_test -onetest compflags/bradc/help/userhelp.chpl

from the top of the test directory, then to take the
userhelp.comp.out.tmp file, remove the first two lines, 
and copy the rest into userhelp.txt.

If we decided that the help message should not print
out the compiler version, we could remove the need
to update a .txt file rather than the .good file
directly.

Why do we have this test?  (1) because we care about
how help looks to the user, and (2) because the test
forces us to think about how and where the new flag
should go rather than just throwing it in and making
a mess as we did earlier.
