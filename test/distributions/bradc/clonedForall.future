mystery: why does this forall result in two copies of the body?

This was pointed out by Srinivas -- forall loops over distributions,
like RA result in two identical copies of the loop body in question in
the generated code.  It wasn't clear why this would be and it may be a
performance issue, so I wanted to capture it.  The cloning seems to
occur in lowerIterators, but I haven't taken it any farther than that
yet.
