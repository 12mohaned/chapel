bug: declaring multiple simple array aliases crashes with a segfault

Seems we currently don't handle this test very nicely.

Notes on the test:

* It tests (a) that multiple and transitive aliasing works, and
(b) that memory is cleaned up nicely.

* With the upcoming segfault fix, the memory is cleaned up completely,
i.e. 'm2 - m1' reports 0, for the default distribution, but not for Block.

Therefore I include compopts to force the default distribution.
