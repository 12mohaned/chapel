The robustness tests are contained in the following directories based
on functionality tested:

  basics/      basic domain and array functionality, e.g., iteration
  collapsing/  rank change slicing in which dimensions are collapsed
  composite/   combinations of functionality in other directories
  kernels/     small kernels, e.g., jacobi
  modules/     tests of calling standard module functions on arrays and domains
  reindexing/  reindexing
  resizing/    changing a domain so that the array is resized
  slicing/     slicing
  stress/      stress tests, e.g., creating many distributed arrays in a loop
  trivial/     trivial domain and array functionality, e.g., A.eltType

Each directory should contain a NUMLOCALES file with the value 4 and a
compopts directory with the line "-M../" so that the test can use the
driver module located in this directory.
