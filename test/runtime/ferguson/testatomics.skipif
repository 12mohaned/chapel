CHPL_ATOMICS==locks
# Skipping under valgrind because of an error like this:
# Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
#   at 0x400642: atomic_store_explicit_bool (chpl-atomics.h:310)
#   by 0x40066E: atomic_store_bool (chpl-atomics.h:310)
#   by 0x401728: main (testatomics.test.c:77)
#
# and looking at the implementation of atomic_store_explicit_bool, it
# does in fact have a loop depending on an uninitialized value
# (because it checks that a compare-and-swap worked)
