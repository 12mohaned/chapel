unimplemented feature: overriding iterators

Overriding these() in a subclass results in a type conflict:

$ chpl dyndispatch_these.chpl --no-devel
dyndispatch_these.chpl:4: error: conflicting return type specified for ':A.these(): _ic_these_A'
dyndispatch_these.chpl:11: error:   overridden by ':B.these(): _ic_these_B'
