bug: user overload of '|' operator on classes breaks internal modules

For some reason when a user overload of '|' on classes exists, it
breaks internal uses of '|' for param functions like isBoolType()
by introducing another overload.  Explain call suggests that the
breaking call is |(0,0) even though the calls in question ought
to be generating |(false,false) calls, which is also surprising.
I haven't been able to reproduce this in a simple test case yet.
