It makes it through analysis now.  I am stripping out the
Null class typing before cloning so you won't be getting
Null as a type for the variable.  Hope that is OK.

HISTORY

It appears that when a class variable is never initialized,
it causes problems in analysis rather than being considered
a nil instance of the class (this may be related to the
fact that John didn't realize this had been decided until
last week?)
