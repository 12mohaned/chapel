params in classes

This test is a future either because (a) it's reporting an error when
it shouldn't, or (b) the error message could be clearer.  I don't have
a strong opinion today about whether (a) or (b) is preferable, but
didn't want to lose it in either case.

One might argue (a) is the correct result given that
weirdParamInit.chpl and weirdParamInit2.chpl seem to work --
weirdParamInit3.chpl seems like a logical extension to what those two
are doing.

If (b) it should be an error then the message could be improved by (i)
saying something about why it's illegal (param is being initialized by
a non-param expression?) and (ii) producing a line number that
corresponds to the field's declaration point rather than the class'.
My guess is that the error is being triggered in the default
constructor which is created on the class line, raising the question
about whether the default constructor's default arguments and
assignments could have their line numbers faked to refer to the member
declarations' line numbers for more clarity.
