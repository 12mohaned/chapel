The test now fails in copyType when it tries
to copy the _integer64 in a Sequence.


HISTORY

I was trying to create a test that showed that our
record assignment scheme (leveraging C's) is naive,
but failed.  Still, this is an interesting test.
Like most current sequence types, it fails in
analysis.
