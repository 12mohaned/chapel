We talked about Steve using the new error reporting
mechanism to convert this at the higher level.   If
we want to patch it at the low level assign it back to
me (jplevyak).

HISTORY

We determined that this test was appropriately ambiguous because
myD.y is C|nilType and nilType is a subclass of C and D, so the
call to foo() is ambiguous.  However, we also decided that it would
be nice to have some mode -- perhaps the default -- in which this
worked as a naive C++/Java programmer would expect.  So I'm filing
this future to remember that we should work on this, and/or create
an error message that is more tailored to this (somewhat confusing)
case.
