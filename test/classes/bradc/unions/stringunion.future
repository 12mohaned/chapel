union

As a first step, this is dependent on getting unions working,
and all of those tests are currently assigned to deitz.

HISTORY

String fields of unions are tricky because in general we can't assume
that there will be a legal string pointer there.  It seems that any
write to a string field of a union will have to do a malloc and that
any write to a different field where the old field was a string will
have to do a free.
