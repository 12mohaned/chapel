bug: forall array type in class body

bug: array in class/record gives internal error

I'm not sure what's different between this test and other
array-in-record/class codes, but it causes an internal error.  Tried
to narrow it down by commenting stuff out, but to no avail.

These tests also lead to semantic questions about the constness of
array fields of records passed by const.  If this should result in a
compile error, it'd be worth splitting this test into two cases so
that the other cases can be tested.
