bug: arrays of arrays in classes

It appears that arrays of arithmetic arrays in classes do
not currently work -- a bogus domain value is passed into
the domain/array initialization routines at some point.

This is currently why associative domains/arrays of arrays
do not work -- since they are implemented with an array
within a class, making the element type of the array
relies on this same behavior.
