bug: generic types

The problem is that the second argument's default expression is
evaluated before the substitution of type1.  This can be fixed by
cascading instantiation so that we instantiate functions one formal
argument at a time.

WAS:

Seems like this test ought to work, but it doesn't seem 
to be.  The error message isn't very good either (doesn't
point to a location because the type symbol in question
is dtAny?).
