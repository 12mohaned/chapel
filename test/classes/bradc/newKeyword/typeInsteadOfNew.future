error message: old constructor syntax results in confusing message

The error message I currently get for this test is:

typeInsteadOfNew.chpl:10: error: unresolved type specifier 'C(domain(1,int(64),0))'
typeInsteadOfNew.chpl:5: note: candidates are: C()

I'm wondering if there's something clearer we could say here -- in
particular, the following seems confusing:

- the message refers to a type specifier, but it seems like I didn't
  type one.

- the error message lists a 0-argument constructor as an option, but
  it doesn't seem like there is one (the default constructor should
  have arguments, e.g.)


I put a candidate error message in the .good file which more clearly
describes the problem, but I'm open to other suggestions as well.
