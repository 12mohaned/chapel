unimplemented: Should diagnose on an attempt to coerce to type object.

Right now, there is no way to specify separate behavior for coercion in the
class itself.  Standard behavior allows coercion to a base class type without an
explicit cast, and there is no way to override this on a per-class basis.  Look
for coercion as a language feature to allow overriding the default behavior, or
special-case code to disable this coercion along with very special code to allow
syncvars to be cast pursuant to being freed/reallocated.

Designer take note! To disallow coercion and then permit an explicit cast, the
casting behavior (where provided) must dominate.
