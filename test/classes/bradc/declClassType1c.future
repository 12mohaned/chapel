Superficially, it seems as though the declared type of the
class is ignored.  I suspect that this relates to the
discussion we had of handling nil and passing it to functions
that we had during your visit (though this is a slightly
special case since it's a setter so from the user's point of
view, it doesn't appear to be a function call).

Interestingly, note that version 1b which starts out assigning the
variable a legal instance and then reassigns it to nil does
work...  This seems somewhat surprising to me (though I was happy that
it worked).

If these tests reflect a misunderstanding on my part, let me know and
I'll fix them up.
