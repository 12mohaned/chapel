bug: Destructor not called with --no-local.

The call to the destructor is removed at line 717 of parallel.cpp by the clause:
716          if (call->isResolved()->hasFlag(FLAG_AUTO_DESTROY_FN)) {
717            call->remove();
because the function has the FLAG_AUTO_DESTROY_FN flag attached.

So either the flag needs to be removed or the clause does.  Some experimentation required.
