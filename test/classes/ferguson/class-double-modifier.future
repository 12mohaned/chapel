semantic: classes can be modified twice

It seems counterintuitive to me that Chapel would permit two class
modifiers to be applied to a class type, yet it seems that this is
currently the case.  I believe that this should generate an error of
some sort, where I've taken a quick stab at what would be more helpful
in the .good file here.

I imagine that a challenge in getting this right is that it's a
case that would want to distinguish between `C` and `borrowed C`
where we normally interpret the former as the latter.

There's more discussion on this question on the PR that filed this
future #12603.
