feature request: creating a type alias for an instantiated generic class

This seems to be running into problems connected to
normalizing PRIM_NEW calls before resolving. It
should be possible to move this handling of PRIM_NEW
calls to be in function resolution, but there
are probably other necessary changes for improving
constructor/initializers.
