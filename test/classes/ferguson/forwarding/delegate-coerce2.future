bug: coercion in delegated methods

When forwarded methods include two overloads for the same function, the
behavior can depend on the order of resolution. In particular, in this
example, the int(8) version is never selected because the int(64) version
is created first and int(8) can coerce to int(64), so that version seems
suitable.

A possible workaround might be to populate all forwarding wrappers
for a given name at once.

Another possibility might be to enable forwarding methods to participate
with other methods in the regular overload resolution process.
