bug: can't call method on generic record arg in record initializer

This is a generalized version of initCallsDom.future.  The issue is that
the compiler tries to use generic single argument record initializers in
initCopy calls as copy initializers, but the initializers defined in these
tests were not intended as copy initializers.  Work has been done to allow
records that don't define copy initializers to not trigger this error message,
but that examination depends on the argument list, not the resolution of the
function itself.
