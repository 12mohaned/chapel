bug: compiler-generated initializers are insufficiently generic for arrays

This test, in combination with arrayField-userInit.chpl, suggests that
compiler-generated initializers are too strict with respect to array
fields as compared to what you would expect the construcer signature
to look like (as illustrated in userCtor.chpl -- the initializer there
is more simplistic than what the compiler would introduce, but doesn't
seem to be the problem/difference as far as I can tell).

This was historically a problem with constructors as well (issue
#5289), but I've retired that since we're working on retiring
constructors.  I'd been hoping that when we i introduced compiler
initializers, the rewrite would cause the problem to go away as well,
but no such luck it seems.

This is logged in issue #6711.
