bug: issue with initializers on bigint type being returned in certain situations

Returning directly the result of a reduction over an array created in the same
expression with a size of 1..0 causes an execution segfault at the deinitializer
call.  If the reduction result is saved into a temporary first, and we are
compiling in developer mode, then the program will stop segfaulting (unless we
are calling the function from a loop for some reason?).  If we are not in
developer mode, saving the reduction result does not avoid the bug.  However,
if we save the created array into a temporary, the program will always execute
correctly.

This version covers saving the reduction result into a temporary when the
function is called from a loop.
