feature request: return concrete class

This test shows a pattern that would be nice to support in which we
have a type function that returns a concrete instantiation of a
generic type (in this case, it's fully qualified, though one might
also want a partially instantiated case to work).  However, this
doesn't work at present.  I also tried supplying a duplicate 'int'
argument in the argument list to the `new` expression, but that
didn't work either (i.e.,

  var myC = new (getType(int))(int);

This is probably somewhat related to issue #5143.
