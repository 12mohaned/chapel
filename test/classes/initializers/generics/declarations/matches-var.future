semantic: how to declare var instantiation in new generics world?

With generic fields no longer tied to a guaranteed specific argument, how does
one declare an instantiation when the class or record has a generic var or const
field?  Type and param fields can only be initialized with an argument that is
of the same kind.  But the var instantiation is based on the type of what is
given to it.
