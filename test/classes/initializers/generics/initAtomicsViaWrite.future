bug: internal error attempting to write atomics in generic class initializer

Something about this test results in an internal error.  I don't think
this test should work (*), but I stumbled across it while looking for a
correct solution.

(*) = Because the compiler presumably shouldn't view a .write() as an
initialization of the atomic?  Yet interestingly, if I remove the
generic field, it does work, so maybe I'm wrong in that assumption?
