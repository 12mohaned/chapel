bug: Casting a nil class to a subclass causes a segfault.

When the argument of a cast is nil, no error checking is performed to see if
the arguement is nil, even without --fast.

We are currently unsure if this should be a runtime error or if the cast should
return nil. If the argument is not nil, but the cast does not succed, should
that be an error, or should that return nil.
