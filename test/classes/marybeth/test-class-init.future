feature request:  be able to initialize fields in a class or record
  with an initialize method so that once a field is initialized, it also 
  initializes subsequent fields that may use that field.

This test contains the following class:

class Params {
  var numProbSizes: int;
  var N: [1..numProbSizes] int;

  def initialize() {
    numProbSizes = 3;
    for n in N do n = 10;
  }
}

With the current implementation of the compiler, N's domain
remains empty after initialize, rather than reflect the initialized
value of numProbSizes.
