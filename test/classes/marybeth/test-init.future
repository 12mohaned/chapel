bug: conditional expression in class body

?

deitz

This test fails with:

[astutil.cpp:377] test3.chpl:5: error: Unexpected scope in FnSymbol

The const in class TestRandom is initialized with an if statement.
I think this is a bug, or we need a better error statement and to
qualify how variables can be initialized in classes.
