The problem here is that accessors are being created
for instance variables which are copied from the partent.

Maybe this should be the case for "with", but probably
not for inheritance.  

Since the variable is both a C and a D at various
times within the "foo" function the access can be
either the one created for for C or D and hence the
dispatch.  If the accessors are inherited (rather than
duplicated) then cloning would know that a single
function would suffice and there would be no dispatch.
