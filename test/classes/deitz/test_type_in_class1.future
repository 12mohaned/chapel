bug: constructor method called in class body

David: All three of these (test_nested1.chpl, test_nested2.chpl,
test_type_in_class1.chpl) are futures due to classes setting member
variables' initializations to values returned by methods defined
within the same class.  In these it's the call to the constructors of
the nested classes.  Currently this gets translated as essentially:

innerclass tmp = this.construct_innerclass();
this = construct_outerclass(tmp);

An almost identical problem happens with module level variables
initialized to function calls.
