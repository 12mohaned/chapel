bug: non-nilable anymanaged class member not given a value and not writeln()'d fails to compile generated source
#14380

If thing2 is declared nilable, it triggers #14378.

If thing2 remains non-nilable but is given a management class, it
correctly fails to compile due to thing2 not being
default-initializable.

If thing1 is initialized as new Thing1(new Thing2()), it compiles
and runs fine.
