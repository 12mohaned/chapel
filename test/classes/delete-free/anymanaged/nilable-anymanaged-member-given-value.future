bug: nilable anymanaged member with object passed to default initializer -> assertion failure in removeSymbolsWithRemovedTypes()
#14378

If the thing2 member is declared non-nilable, it compiles and runs fine.

If thing2 is declared with a management class and the same management
class is applied to the new Thing2() arg, it compiles and runs
fine. So it seems specific to an anymanaged member.
