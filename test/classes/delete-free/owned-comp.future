bug: Should the comparison method within the owned class "work"?

I can see why this doesn't simply work, but it seems like it would
be attractive/productive/convenient if it did.

This was motivated by trying to make a variation on chameneos-blc.chpl
that used owned Chameneos to avoid the need for the deletes at the end
of main().
