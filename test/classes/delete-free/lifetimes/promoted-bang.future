bug: lifetime checking problem with promoted !

// transferArray(A, B!)
// -> B! is promoted and this confuses the compiler
// -> it is inferring a lifetime != B for the expression B!
//     (which is an iterator record)
// TODO: think about the lifetime of iterator records/promoted expressions
//    - would implementing the promotion differently address this?
