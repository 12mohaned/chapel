bug: explicit variable type declaration changes array alias to copy

A variable which is a record containing an array gets an alias to the
initializer's array if its type is inferred, but a copy of the initializer's
array if its type is explicit. Both cases should have the same behavior, I'm
leaning toward a copy.
