bug: type method with default argument causes compiler error

A type method with a default argument causes an "illegal assignment of type
to value" error. The error is coming from a wrapper for the method, where it
assigns "this" to a temp.  Since it is a type method, "this" is a type.

Calling the method with an argument avoids the wrapper and succeeds.
