bug: odd type name due to partial instantiation

Was:

bug: generic class is instantiated twice, causing a strange name

This class has 3 parameter fields. In this error message, the class is
instantiated first for its first two fields, then again for its last field.
This makes the type name: "C(1,1)(3)"
