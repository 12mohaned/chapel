bug: when compiled and run on JC's Mac, this code segfaults
right after printing out "hello"

Triage:
- Seems like the C generated code is the same on mac and my linux
  box (modulo passing the line numbers).
- The C representation corresponding to 'c.r' in the Chapel source
  seems to get corrupted, possibly during the call to writeln().
- When in gdb, the crash is reproducible - unless I step through
  the program line by line.

This makes me think that there is something else going on on the Mac
in parallel with the main program being executed, making the behavior
nondeterministic.
