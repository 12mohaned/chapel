Data Parallel Hands-on exercise: C-ray ray tracing
==================================================

Overview
--------

This directory contains the framework for writing a ray-tracing
program in Chapel.  All of the ray tracing complexity that converts a
pixel coordinate into a color value is provided to you, as are utility
routines that can write out BMP or PPM files.  All you have to do is
follow the directions below to create an array representing the image
and compute its pixel values.


File List
---------

Important files in this directory are as follows:

c-ray.chpl   : The main Chapel ray-tracing source file
Image.chpl   : A helper module for creating image files
Makefile     : A trivial Makefile showing how to compile the program
scene        : A simple scene file describing four spheres
sphfract     : A more complex scene file describing a fractal pattern
scene.bmp    : The expected BMP file for 'scene'
scene.ppm    : The expected PPM file for 'scene'
sphfract.bmp : The expected BMP file for 'sphfract'
sphfract.ppm : The expected PPM file for 'sphfract'
README       : This file

If present, the following files are related to the Chapel testing
system, which we use to maintain this code.  They can be ignored for
the purposes of the hands-on exercise:

CATFILES
CLEANFILES
c-ray.execopts
c-ray.good
Image.notest



Instructions
------------

which you should be able to view in any standard image viewing
program.  You can also create PPM files by supplying an image filename
with the '.ppm' extension.  Running the program with --usage will
print out a help message describing this option and others.

Once you're ready to start programming, browse the source code to your
heart's content, then jump to the main() procedure where comments
labeled STEP 0, STEP 1, STEP 2, etc. will guide you through the
exercise.

STEP 0: Compile and run the framework
-------------------------------------

* Compile 'c-ray.chpl' as it stands (e.g. 'chpl c-ray.chpl').

* Run the resulting program (e.g., './c-ray').

* You should get a new file 'image.bmp' containing a small black
  rectangular image (which should be viewable using your favorite
  image viewer).

* Run the program with --usage to print out a help message describing
  the options that will affect its behavior (most of which won't have
  any effect until you start ray-tracing.

* Browse the code as much or as little as you'd like.


STEP 1: Declare and write your image array
------------------------------------------

* Find the first "TODO" section in the program and replace it with an
  array declaration (and optionally a domain for the array) that
  describes the image of pixels to render.  The array should store
  'yres' x 'xres' pixel elements of type 'pixelType' (a configurable
  type alias defined in the 'Image.chpl' module).

  Note: graphics people (and the program's '--size' argument) describe
  images using Width x Height where Chapel typically uses Rows x Cols,
  which is why the program often uses (y, x) values rather than (x, y)
  to represent this transposition.

* Find the call to writeImage() at the end of main() and replace its
  passing of the 'dummy' array with the one you created.

* When you re-compile and run the program now, you should see a black
  image whose size corresponds to the --size argument.  Try running it
  with different values to verify this.


STEP 2: Compute the ray tracing using a serial loop
---------------------------------------------------

* Find the second "TODO" section in the program, bracketed by timer
  calls, and replace it with a computation of your image array's
  values via calls to 'computePixel()' (pre-defined further down in
  the file).  For this step, try using a serial loop.

* After re-compiling and re-running, do you get a reasonable image?

* Use the --scene config const to try reading in a more interesting
  sccene like 'sphfract'.

* Try experimenting with setting other configuration options on the
  command-line to see if they work as expected.  See the list of
  options by searching on 'config' at the top of the file, or by
  running the program with the --usage flag.

* Time how long the rendering takes.  Recompile with the --fast flag
  (intended for performance runs, once a program is working, it will
  turn off various execution-time checks and turn on back-end compiler
  optimizations).  Note these timings for future reference.


STEP 3: Compute the ray tracing using a parallel loop
-----------------------------------------------------

* Try changing your serial loop to a parallel one and make sure your
  code still produces the right image.

* What kind of speed improvements do you see over the serial loop?
  (with or without --fast?)


STEP 4: Compute the ray tracing using promotion
-----------------------------------------------

* Can you write the computation using promotion?  Does it affect the
  speed at all?


STEP 5 (optional): Try the dynamic load balancing iterator
----------------------------------------------------------

* Ray tracing can be notoriously poorly load balanced since some
  pixels result in far more ray bounces than others.  Can you achieve
  a speed improvement by applying the dynamic() iterator from the
  DynamicIters module:

    https://chapel-lang.org/docs/modules/standard/DynamicIters.html

  Do you need to create a more load-imbalanced scene (or increase the
  degree of parallelism?) in order to see a noticeable difference?


**********************************************************************
* The following steps are intended for later in the day, though      *
* you're welcome to work ahead if you breezed through the prior steps*
**********************************************************************


STEP 6: Distribute the computation of the image
-----------------------------------------------

* Starting from step 3 or 4, make your array a distributed array by
  making its domain a distributed domain.  Do you still get the
  correct image?

* Do you see additional overhead relative to your previous timings due
  to the additional complexity of distributed arrays?

* If you've been working from a laptop, you've probably been compiling
  in '--local' mode, which is the default when CHPL_COMM=none (which
  is the default for laptops).  If you've been working from a Cray or
  cluster, you've likely been compiling in '--no-local' mode, which is
  the default when CHPL_COMM!=none.  Try compiling in both '--local'
  and '--no-local' modes to see what kind of overhead is added when
  compiling the code for a single vs. multiple locales.


STEP 7: Get set up to run on multiple locales
---------------------------------------------

* One way to run using multiple locales is to run on a Cray or
  cluster.  This is also the way to (potentially) see parallel speedup
  as you run on an increasing number of locales.

* You can also set up your laptop to run multiple locales in an
  oversubscribed manner (essentially, each locale will be a distinct
  process running on your laptop).  The following instructions are
  designed to help you with this:

    https://chapel-lang.org/docs/platforms/udp.html

  The following instructions are more generally about multi-locale
  execution, for example on a cluster:

    https://chapel-lang.org/docs/usingchapel/multilocale.html

* Try running your program using two locales (or more) using the
  '-nl'/'--numLocales' flags.

  Note: Initially, you may need to reduce the image size using the
  '--size' flag to make this step complete in a tractable amount of
  time.

* Do you see a performance improvement or slip when running on
  multiple locales?  (note that on a laptop, the best you should be
  able to do is break even since all of the "locales" are sharing the
  same physical resources).

* What could you do within the code to "prove" to yourself that
  different locales are involved in computing the various pixels?

* Why are things so slow when running on multiple locales?  Are you
  able to figure this out either by (1) reasoning about the code, or
  (2) using the CommDiagnostics module:

    https://chapel-lang.org/docs/modules/standard/CommDiagnostics.html

  or (3) using the 'chplvis' tool:

    https://chapel-lang.org/docs/tools/chplvis/chplvis.html


STEP 8: Make the program scale
---------------------------------

* Given the answer to the previous question (check with the
  instructors if you need help with it), what can you do to make the
  ray-tracing scalable?  How close can you get to linear speed-up as
  you add locales?
