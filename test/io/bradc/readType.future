feature request: read(type t)

Would like a standalone read() function that takes a type and returns
a value of that type.  We support this on files, but to do so for
standalone requires hacking the compiler or pulling the read() call
out of the compiler -- since David plans on doing the latter anyway,
that seems like the better time to get this working.
