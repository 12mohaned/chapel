bug: varargs type function considered to return type?

This test yields an "illegal assignment of type to value"
error, which seems to imply that a varargs type function
is returning a type rather than a value.  Once this test
is working, the four functions listed here should be
moved to ChapelIO.chpl (adding them now breaks other tests).
