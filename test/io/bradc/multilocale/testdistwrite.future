bug: can't write to a remote Writer

This is a bug I ran into when implementing I/O functions for
block-sparse distributions where I wanted each locale to write out its
own index set by using an on-clause to move onto each locale in
question.  It turned out that there was no on-clause within the
writer implementation itself.  Michael has since added a fix and
will commit it imminently.
