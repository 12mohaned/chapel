error message: warn that statement has no effect

Requesting a warning or error message.  This is an easy mistake for C, C++,
Java, etc programmers that is often difficult to spot once it's been made.  It
was pointed out that this warning is not trivial to generate since it is
possible that a user has overloaded unary - to have an effect.
