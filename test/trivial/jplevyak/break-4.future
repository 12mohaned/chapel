Support for basic control flow.  Need to resolve 
the targets.  I can do this for you decide what
sort of data structure you want (e.g. do you
want a "Stmt *target" in GotoStmt, BreakStmt, ContinueStmt).
These things would have to be fixed up during copy and
inlining, so I have left it to you to decided how you
want to handle it.  The other alternative is to
uniquify the labels in some manner and to have different
labels for break and continue for each loop....
