Steve: I think we should make this illegal.  No inout, out, or in intents to iterators.

Currently do not support inout arguments to iterators. Two problems are 1)
knowning which iterator to resolve to and 2) the iterator interface would
have to change to pass along the inout argument (e.g., getNextCursor).
