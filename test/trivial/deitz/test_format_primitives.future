The problem is that the chpl_complex.chpl module only has one version 
of _chpl_tostring which only handles complex, as a result resolveSymbols 
thinks it is not overloaded and subs in the FnSymbol which forces analysis 
to use only that one version (which doesn't apply) for all other uses of _chpl_tostring....

Since this has to do with module resolution which is a new feature and I
wanted to record these observations I am making this a future.
