???

It's unfortunate that for this test the first errors given are:

- that _tmp has no type (_tmp is not a user variable)
- that '=' is unresolved (listing 13 candidates)
- that x is an illegal call argument type (to =, I'm assuming)
- that _tmp is an illegal call argument type (to =, I'm assuming again)

before getting to the message that indicates the real problem -- there
is no function 'foo' (given here as an unresolved call 'foo' with no
candidates).  Is there any way that we could get this message, which
would be most useful to tracking this error down, up to the top of the
error list?  Can function calls with 0 candidates be flagged before we
get to this point if it's not simple to do at this point in
compilation?
