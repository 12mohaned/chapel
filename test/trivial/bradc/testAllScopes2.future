This test no longer works because of the fact that we don't
successfully split VarDeclStmts into the declaration and
the initialization, as C requires.  As a result, when we
tuck var declarations that call functions into a new local
scope, the scope of the variable itself is wrong.  This
is a good incentive to do an AST rewrite that we've been
planning for some time.

Note that once we get this working, we *may* think about
replacing testAllScopes.chpl with testAllScopes2.chpl
(which was the original test).  Though on the other
hand, if we don't come up with a better test for the
splitting of VarDeclStmts, maybe keeping both is a good
idea.
