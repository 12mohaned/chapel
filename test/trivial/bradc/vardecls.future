Need to generate type-specific initializers for variables.
This is slightly non-trivial, since not all legal Chapel
initializers will be legal C initializers.  Thus, in some
cases (or perhaps all for symmetry?), the type-specific
initializers should be generated as assignments following
the variable declarations.
