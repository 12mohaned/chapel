bug: empty module results in "multiple modules, no main" error

This may be Mac-specific, but it seems that when a file
contains no executable code, it results in a multiple
modules, no main error.  I'd expect this to work and
generate a no-op program, or at least to generate a
message that doesn't suggest there are multiple modules.
