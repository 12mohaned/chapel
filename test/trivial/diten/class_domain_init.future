uninitialized domain field

Domain fields are brittle and special-cased by the compiler in a
few places.  This looks like a good test to work on in order to
get an array of arrays working.  The issue is that the domain is
set to nil, but it shouldn't be, because it is a value type.

This class should allow the domain "D" to be assigned to by the initialize 
method.  Instead it causes a segmentation violation.
