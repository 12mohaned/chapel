bug: missing writer method for file type

When trying to write a variable of file type, the compiler will
complain that it can't find a write method for this type.

Isn't the file type implemented as a record or class?  Why doesn't
it use the record or class writer method then?

Also, the error message about the compiler not being able to resolve
the call to the write method is quite long since it lists all possible
candidates.  Can this resolution error message be smarter?  That is, when
trying to resolve against methods or functions that are provided by Chapel,
don't list all possible Chapel internal candidates?
