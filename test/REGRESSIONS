linux regressions
=================

[Error matching compiler output for classes/deitz/test_class_list1]

This test is failing because the accessors are being created
for clones.  They shouldn't be as analysis will clone the
accessors separately.  New accessors should only be created
for generic instantitation.

[Error matching compiler output for classes/deitz/test_type_in_class1]

This test is failing because it is attempting to resolveSymbols for
the ->init in a VarDefStmt in a Type which is ever executed (it 
is copied and the copy is executed) and so analysis knows nothing about it.

[Error matching compiler output for types/tuple/bradc/writeTuple]

This is failing because we currently cannot add methods to TupleTypes
and tuple indexing is handled through methods so Tuple is a class
which confuses codegen.

[Error matching compiler output for types/tuple/deitz/test_tuple_simple1]

This is failing because we currently cannot add methods to TupleTypes
and tuple indexing is handled through methods so Tuple is a class
which confuses codegen.


linux64-only regressions
========================

memory/shannon/mallocOutOfMemory -- causes OS to thrash around; need
  to limit memory allocation for this test (shannon/bradc)

memory/shannon/configVarFile -- sizeof() returning different sizes;
  need to neutralize this somehow (shannon/bradc)
