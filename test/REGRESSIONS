linux and general regressions
=============================

[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_basic1]
[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_of_record1]

  Fail because the new wrapper constructor for the class is not called
  when the array is initialized.  The array needs a constructor so
  that its initialization code can be analyzed.


linux64-specific regressions
============================

memory/shannon/memstatPrint:
memory/shannon/printFinalMemStat:

  I fixed these regressions on the Sun and valgrind linux runs, but I'm 
  not sure why it's still failing here.  I'll take a look.  (shannon)


memory/shannon/printMemTable

  need to implement a way to filter memtable when printing to filter
  out small allocations that are platform-dependent (like structs with
  pointer values).



cygwin-specific regressions
===========================



freebsd-specific regressions
============================



sunos-specific regressions
==========================
trivial/shannon/compSampler:

  GC complains about repeated allocation of very large block for
  unknown reason (???)
