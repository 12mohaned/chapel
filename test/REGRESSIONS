# USAGE: the intent of this file is to keep track of current
# regressions and to keep notes about why they are failing.  Since
# linux is our main platform, linux regressions are listed first, and
# will typically apply to all other platforms as well.  Variations on
# linux (linux with valgrind and linux64) are listed next.  Other
# platforms follow, listed alphabetically.  Regressions that are not
# found on linux should be listed under the platforms in question.
# Formatting for each entry can be loose, but should roughly follow
# the format of test name(s), followed by a description of why that
# test is failing, followed by an indication of whose court the
# regression is in.

  Parameters need to be initialized in certain contexts (e.g., global
  variables), we should check for this context in checkSemantics (the
  old check is commented out).  Or, we could make class/function
  instantiation set up a new initializer for the parameter after its
  been instantiated so that the test would pass for all parameters.

  These are all caused by visibility problems with instantiated functions.

  Anonymous records are defined in functions and their methods are
  nested functions.  These are not being handled well by
  RemoveNestedFunctions.
