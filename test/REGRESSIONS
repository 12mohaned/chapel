# USAGE: the intent of this file is to keep track of current
# regressions and to keep notes about why they are failing.  Since
# linux is our main platform, linux regressions are listed first, and
# will typically apply to all other platforms as well.  Variations on
# linux (linux with valgrind and linux64) are listed next.  Other
# platforms follow, listed alphabetically.  Regressions that are not
# found on linux should be listed under the platforms in question.
# Formatting for each entry can be loose, but should roughly follow
# the format of test name(s), followed by a description of why that
# test is failing, followed by an indication of whose court the
# regression is in.

We need to handle PRIMITIVE_GET_MEMBER during pre-instantiation
  for the case of foo.t  where t is a type variable in foo.

We need to handle unspecified '_' OP_INIT better.

[Error executing program arrays/deitz/test_array_basic1a]

We need to initialize elements of an array.  I believe the current init primitive should not serve this purpose with the representative element as this will not result in calling the default constructor for each element in the array.

What are we going to do for class constructors?
