[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_of_class1]
[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_of_record1]
[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_basic1]

  Fail in wrapper of set accessor.  It looks like
  positional_arg_positions is too big.

  NOTE: The interface for the coercion wrapper has been updated.

  Also fail because the new wrapper constructor for the class is not
  called when the array is initialized.  The array needs a constructor
  so that its initialization code can be analyzed.

[Error matching compiler output for classes/deitz/test_type_in_class1]

  This test is failing because it is attempting to resolveSymbols for
  the ->init in a VarDefStmt in a Type which is ever executed (it is
  copied and the copy is executed) and so analysis knows nothing about
  it.

  SJD Update: I just checked this out and if I call type_is_used on
  the Type I get a true.

[Error matching compiler output for classes/deitz/test_type_in_class2]
[Error matching compiler output for classes/bradc/records/assignRecord]

  Fails in analysis because of the new constructor with parameters.
