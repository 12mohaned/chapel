# USAGE: the intent of this file is to keep track of current
# regressions and to keep notes about why they are failing.  Since
# linux is our main platform, linux regressions are listed first, and
# will typically apply to all other platforms as well.  Variations on
# linux (linux with valgrind and linux64) are listed next.  Other
# platforms follow, listed alphabetically.  Regressions that are not
# found on linux should be listed under the platforms in question.
# Formatting for each entry can be loose, but should roughly follow
# the format of test name(s), followed by a description of why that
# test is failing, followed by an indication of whose court the
# regression is in.



=============================
linux and general regressions
=============================

[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_basic1]
[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_of_record1]

  Fail because the new wrapper constructor for the class is not called
  when the array is initialized.  The array needs a constructor so
  that its initialization code can be analyzed.

[Error matching compiler output for domains/bradc/writeIndex]
[Error matching compiler output for domains/bradc/writeIndex2]

  There is something very wrong with IndexTypes.  They should not
  need their own write function (bradc).

[Error matching compiler output for flowanalysis/newast/sum_type-1]

  ???


==========================
linux valgrind regressions
==========================

[Error matching compiler output for trivial/shannon/compSampler]

A few of the passes take far too long to complete due to
inefficiencies in the insertBefore/After calls attributable to both
their use and implementation, resulting in a timeout when running
under valgrind (bradc/deitz)


============================
linux64-specific regressions
============================

memory/shannon/printMemTable

  need to implement a way to filter memtable when printing to filter
  out small allocations that are platform-dependent (like structs with
  pointer values) (shannon)



===========================
cygwin-specific regressions
===========================

[Error matching compiler output for flowanalysis/newast/sum_type-2]

freebsd-specific regressions
