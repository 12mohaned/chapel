# USAGE: the intent of this file is to keep track of current
# regressions and to keep notes about why they are failing.  Since
# linux is our main platform, linux regressions are listed first, and
# will typically apply to all other platforms as well.  Variations on
# linux (linux with valgrind and linux64) are listed next.  Other
# platforms follow, listed alphabetically.  Regressions that are not
# found on linux should be listed under the platforms in question.
# Formatting for each entry can be loose, but should roughly follow
# the format of test name(s), followed by a description of why that
# test is failing, followed by an indication of whose court the
# regression is in.

functions/mjoyner/nested/mutual_recursive.chpl:

  when dealing with mutually recursive nested functions, Mack inserts
  actual parameters that referred to a non-local variable rather than
  the local actual parameters (mjoyner)

classes/shannon/varIntTypedSetInConstructor
functions/deitz/test_named_default_gotcha

  These tests bop in and out of failure at random due to a 
  nondeterministic bug in call-by-parameter-name passing (???)
