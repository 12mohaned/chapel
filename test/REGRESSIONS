# USAGE: the intent of this file is to keep track of current
# regressions and to keep notes about why they are failing.  Since
# linux is our main platform, linux regressions are listed first, and
# will typically apply to all other platforms as well.  Variations on
# linux (linux with valgrind and linux64) are listed next.  Other
# platforms follow, listed alphabetically.  Regressions that are not
# found on linux should be listed under the platforms in question.
# Formatting for each entry can be loose, but should roughly follow
# the format of test name(s), followed by a description of why that
# test is failing, followed by an indication of whose court the
# regression is in.

linux and general regressions

[Error executing program execflags/shannon/configs/configVarFile]
[Error executing program execflags/shannon/configs/configVarFileBadEnum]
[Error executing program execflags/shannon/configs/configVarFileGoodEnum]
[Error executing program execflags/shannon/configs/configVarFileStrings]
[Error executing program memory/shannon/configVarFile]

I expect to be able to remove these regressions once we add support for a primitive assignment operator and remove special-casing of strings. --SJD

linux valgrind regressions

trivial/shannon/compSampler

  This is currently failing because compilation takes too long?
