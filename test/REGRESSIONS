linux regressions
=================

[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_of_record1]
[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_basic1]

  Fail because the new wrapper constructor for the class is not called
  when the array is initialized.  The array needs a constructor so
  that its initialization code can be analyzed.

[Error matching compiler output for classes/deitz/test_type_in_class2]
[Error matching compiler output for classes/bradc/records/assignRecord]

  Fails in analysis because of the new constructor with parameters.

/test/types/type_variables/deitz/test_typevar_class1.chpl

  Fails because FnSymbol::default_wrapper is copying
  formal_change->init which includes a VarInit which
  references the original (pre-copy) formal.



linux valgrind regressions
==========================

memory/shannon/memstatPrint:
memory/shannon/printFinalMemStat:

  Mem stat tests don't seem to be working on Sun, but haven't
  investigated why -- would guess that it's due to realloc bug.
  (shannon)



linux64-specific regressions
============================

memory/shannon/memstatPrint:
memory/shannon/printFinalMemStat:

  See linux valgrind report above.


memory/shannon/printMemTable

  need to implement a way to filter memtable when printing to filter
  out small allocations that are platform-dependent (like structs with
  pointer values).



cygwin-specific regressions
===========================



freebsd-specific regressions
============================



sunos-specific regressions
==========================

memory/shannon/memstatPrint:
memory/shannon/printFinalMemStat:

  (see linux valgrind entry above)


trivial/shannon/compSampler:

  GC complains about repeated allocation of very large block for
  unknown reason (???)
