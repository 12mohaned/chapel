linux regressions
=================

[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_of_class1]
[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_of_record1]

  Fails in wrapper of set accessor.  It looks like
  positional_arg_positions is too big.

  NOTE: The interface for the coercion wrapper has been updated.

[Error matching compiler output for classes/deitz/test_type_in_class1]

  This test is failing because it is attempting to resolveSymbols for
  the ->init in a VarDefStmt in a Type which is ever executed (it is
  copied and the copy is executed) and so analysis knows nothing about
  it.


linux valgrind regressions
==========================



linux64-specific regressions
============================

memory/shannon/printMemTable

  need to implement a way to filter memtable when printing to filter
  out small allocations that are platform-dependent (like structs
  involving pointers) (shannon).



cygwin-specific regressions
===========================



freebsd-specific regressions
============================

memory/shannon/configVarFile:
memory/shannon/jacobi:

  --memthreshold is not working because freebsd does not seem to
  support %lld for reading a long long value in (shannon).



sunos-specific regressions
==========================
