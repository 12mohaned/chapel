linux regressions
=================

[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_of_class1]
[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_of_record1]

  Fails in wrapper of set accessor.  It looks like positional_arg_positions is too big.

[Error matching program output for functions/deitz/test_default_param2]

  Intermittent failures.  Examining.

[Error matching compiler output for classes/deitz/test_type_in_class1]

  This test is failing because it is attempting to resolveSymbols for
  the ->init in a VarDefStmt in a Type which is ever executed (it is
  copied and the copy is executed) and so analysis knows nothing about
  it.



linux valgrind regressions
==========================

memory/shannon/freedMalloc:
memory/shannon/printMemTable:
memory/shannon/reallocZeroSize:
  
  current address printing is too sensitive to address size (shannon)


compflags/bradc/noexec/version:

  this test needs to be generalized for the no-gc version of chpl (bradc)



linux64-specific regressions
============================

memory/shannon/mallocOutOfMemory:

  causes OS to thrash around; need to limit memory allocation for this
  test (shannon/bradc)


memory/shannon/configVarFile:

  sizeof() returning different sizes; need to neutralize this somehow
  (shannon/bradc)



cygwin-specific regressions
===========================



freebsd-specific regressions
============================

compflags/bradc/gdbdash/declint -- ??? (bradc)



sunos-specific regressions
==========================
