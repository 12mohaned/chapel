[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_of_class1]
[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_of_record1]

  Fails in wrapper of set accessor.  It looks like
  positional_arg_positions is too big.

  NOTE: The interface for the coercion wrapper has been updated.

[Error matching compiler output for arrays/deitz/test_array_basic1]

  Fails because the new wrapper constructor for the class is not
  called when the array is initialized.  The array needs a constructor
  so that its initialization code can be analyzed.

[Error matching compiler output for classes/deitz/test_type_in_class1]

  This test is failing because it is attempting to resolveSymbols for
  the ->init in a VarDefStmt in a Type which is ever executed (it is
  copied and the copy is executed) and so analysis knows nothing about
  it.

[Error matching compiler output for classes/deitz/test_type_in_class2]

  The type alias in the class is added to the parameter list.  I think
  types that are fully defined (not type variables) should not be
  added to the parameter list.

[Error matching compiler output for classes/bradc/records/assignRecord]

  Fails in analysis because of the new constructor with parameters.

[Error matching compiler output for classes/jplevyak/record_type_hierarchy-1]
[Error matching compiler output for classes/jplevyak/union_type_hierarchy-1]

  The wrapper constructor is not used as the default constructor
  because call_info on the DefExpr of the object doesn't return
  anything.
