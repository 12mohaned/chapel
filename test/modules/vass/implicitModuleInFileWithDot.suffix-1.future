bug: incorrect name for an implicit module when filename has extra dots

When a source file defines a module implicitly, the module name
is derived from the file's name. Currently the compiler uses
the file name up to the earliest dot. Instead we would like it
to use the name up to the last dot, i.e. simply strip ".chpl"
from the end.

(We should also update the spec to make that clear.
As well as whether the file path, or part thereof,
becomes part of the implicit module name.)
