semantic: assigning type declared in unused module.

Notes from 04/30/08 meeting
---------------------------
* modules should be about names, not capabilities, so the fact
  that main() ends up creating a variable of a class that it
  cannot name isn't necessarily an issue.

* noted that a legal rewrite could be var c: M1.C = bar() if
  we wanted to insist that any inferred type have a rewrite
  with an explicit type.
