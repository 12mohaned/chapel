semantic: can't access field in class defined in unused module

A class defined in one module, returned from a function that uses that module
is kept in a var that doesn't use that module. From that var, the class fields
are not accessible.

Notes from 04/30/08 meeting
---------------------------
* This seems like it might be appropriate -- that modules limit namespaces,
  not semantics.
