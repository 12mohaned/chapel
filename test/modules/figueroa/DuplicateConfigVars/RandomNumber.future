feature request: need a way to avoid exporting all symbols from a module
RandomNumber.chpl defines arraySize and seed as configuration variables,
but they are intended only for use within the main program defined in
this source file.  Trying to make use of this module in some other program
should not cause these configuration variables to be visible in other
modules, but there is currently no way to avoid this.
