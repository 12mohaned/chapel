bug: modules that are not explicitly used 

This is a nonsense program, but I believe it replicates a situation
during internal module resolution.

In this test, module M uses M0, but is not used by the main module (or
any other module).  Resolution fails when trying to resolve the
autocopy function for the record R (defined in M), which is dependent
on a type alias defined in M0.
