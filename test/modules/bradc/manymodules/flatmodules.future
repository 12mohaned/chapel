The issue here is that we are trying to generate code for functions
which are never used.  So, analysis will tell you the return types
of functions which are called, but dtUnkonwn for functions which
are never called.  I can tell you if a function is never called
so that you can avoid generating code.  

I have added a new function to analysis.h:

int function_is_used(FnSymbol *fn);

for this purpose.
