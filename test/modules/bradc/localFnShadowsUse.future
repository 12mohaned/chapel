bug: functions don't shadow module uses as with variables

If foo() was a variable, the local foo() would shadow the
used M2.foo() because the M2 foo() would be put into a
"use scope" (my own term) just above M1's scope, but
adjacent to its lexical scope.  For functions, this same
thing doesn't seem to be happening.
