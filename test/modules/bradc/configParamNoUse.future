bug: config params in a module that is not used

Here is perhaps more evidence that we should require modules to be
used before being used to disambiguate member names.  In this case,
not using M1 before calling into its code that refers to a config
param results in the message:

./configParamNoUse.chpl:4: In function 'foo':
./configParamNoUse.chpl:5: error: actual type is unknown or generic [callInfo.cpp:32]

Could be fixable, but the easiest fix is to use M1 before doing
this call.

The Random module includes an annoying "use" call in its top-level
fillRandom() function for this reason now.  Once we resolve this
issue, it can be removed.
