32-bit math routines

We need to overload our standard math routines to support
32-bit versions of the functions rather than promoting to
the 64-bit versions.  To fix this future, the implementor
should implement all 32-bit math functions that make sense
and generate tests of them rather than simply fixing the
sin() function.
