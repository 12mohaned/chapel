bug: RandomStream follower doesn't track or update global state

The RandomStream class' follower iterator currently uses the indices
provided by the leader as the values to the skipToNth/getNth() calls
rather than starting at the current cursor/count and going forward
from there.  This test demonstrates the issue by using the same stream
to fill two 10-element arrays and then comparing to a 20-element
array.
