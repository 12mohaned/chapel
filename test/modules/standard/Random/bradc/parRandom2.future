feature request: parallel random streams

This is a placeholder future test for myself to work on.  
I'm working on implementing parallel follower iterators
for our random stream class and this test invokes two
streams in parallel and sequentially to make sure that
the same result is generated.

I currently have a non-thread-safe follower implemented
(not checking in on this commit) which causes this code
to compile and run, but to get races in the output.  So
once those races are gone, this future can be removed.
