The .good file for this test must be specified on a
machine-by-machine basis, as the test reports the
amount of physical memory available on a machine.

If anyone knows of a portable way to determine this
value from the command-line (such that we can tuck
it into a prediff script and generate the .good file
on the fly), that would be very useful.
