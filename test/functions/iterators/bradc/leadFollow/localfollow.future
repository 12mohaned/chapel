semantic: local within a follower

What does it mean for a local block to be within a follower?  My
hunch is that it should assert something about the local code in
the follower but not to the body around which the follower is
being placed.  Does this make sense?  Is it implementable?

In the current implementation, the local block seems to disappear,
though I'm not sure why that is.  In localfollow.chpl, this results
in a seg fault as the compiler tries to infer the type of the
follower and can't find anything to grab it from (?).  In
localfollow2.chpl (which has an additional yield outside of the
local block), it just makes the yields within the local block
disappear (and the loop as well?).
