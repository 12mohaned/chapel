bug: cannot zipper domains of different index types

Was:

bug: leaders/followers don't work across index types

It seems that when the compiler inserts some code related to
leaders/followers that either doesn't preserve index types or somehow
tries to mix index types from the leader and follower in a way that it
seems it shouldn't need to.  In particular, compiling this code in
developer mode gives:

$CHPL_HOME/modules/internal/ChapelRange.chpl:223: In function '=':
$CHPL_HOME/modules/internal/ChapelRange.chpl:229: error: type mismatch in assignment from int(64) to int [functionResolution.cpp:1842]

while compiling it in user mode gives:

test/functions/iterators/bradc/leadFollow/diffIndices.chpl:16: error: type mismatch in assignment from int(64) to int


I ran into this with the FFT tests when trying to convert array
assignment from a for loop into a forall loop.
