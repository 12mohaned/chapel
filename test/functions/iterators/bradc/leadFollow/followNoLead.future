semantic: follow iteration without leader?

This is somewhat similar to parNoSolo.future.  The question is
whether an iterator ought to be able to serve as a follower if
it has no leader.  For example, an infinite random stream is
probably better as a follower than it would be as a leader.

If for some reason we require a leader, it would be nice to
specialize the error message text to this case and location
out of the standard modules.  Currently, it is:

$CHPL_HOME/modules/standard/ChapelArray.chpl:636: error: forall loop applied to non-parallel iterator
