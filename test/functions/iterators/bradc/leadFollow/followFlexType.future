bug: follower type not sufficiently flexible

In the current compiler implementation, the follower iterator
can only follow the type of the leader iterator, when we would
like it to be more generic based on the leader that it's actually
being zippered against.  This test demonstrates this by zippering
a leader of type int(32) with a follower of type int(64) and
vice-versa.
