bug: detupled indices drop references to var iterators

(or, in my own words: zippering iterators drops reference semantics
of values being yielded)

This is similar to Steve's functions/deitz/iterators/test_var_iterator2
test, but it took me awhile to determine that, and I figured might as
well add another test of it to increase the value of fixing it.  :)
