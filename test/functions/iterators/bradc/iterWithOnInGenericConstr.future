bug: attempt to heap allocate type

Apparently, when a generic class is constructed within a generic constructor
within an on clause (within an iterator?) the compiler tries to heap allocate
a type when the --no-local flag is on.  Not sure what this means, but this
is the case that I'm trying to work around in the BradsBlock1DPar.chpl
