semantic: Can iterators have side-effects, evaluate them if uncaptured?

This test defines an iterator that has the side-effect of writing 5 lines with
the numbers 5-1. When the iterator result is captured into an array or loop
construct, the side-effects happen. When it is uncaptured, the iterator is not
evaluated, so the side-effects do not happen.
