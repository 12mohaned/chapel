feature request/error message: recursive leader iterators

This test mirrors functions/iterators/bradc/recursiveStandalone.chpl

Text copied from recursiveStandalone.future, with leader replacing standalone:
When writing a recursive leader iterator, we get a somewhat
confusing error message pointing to an internal module.  This future
can be perceived as a feature request to add support for recursive
leader iterators, if possible.  Or, if not, as a request
to improve the error message if there's a good reason that we can't
support recursive leader iterators.
