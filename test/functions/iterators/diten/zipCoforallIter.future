bug: iterator with yield in coforall doesn't handle zippered iteration

This test has the same problem as:
multilocale/deitz/oneOrMoreLocales/test_reduce_of_promote_of_distributed.chpl

It has zippered iteration over a parallel iterator. At the beginning of the
iterator, there are gotos to jump to just after the yield points. In this case,
the yield is inside of a coforall loop, which is moved into a function, so
the label ends up in a different function from the goto. Since there are no
gotos to the label in the function where it is defined, it gets removed.
