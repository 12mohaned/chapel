bug: compiler crashes with an improper AST when the program defines two recursive leader iterators

This test is the same as

  recursive-iterator-twice-local.chpl
  recursive-iterator-twice-local.future

except it retains the 'on' clauses from

  functions/deitz/iterators/leader_follower/test_recursive_leader3.chpl

(This latter test is the inspiration and the source for both of these tests
recursive-iterator-twice-*.chpl.)
