bug: non-'var' iterator yielding arrays does so by value when the return type is specified explicitly

According to the group consensus documented in spec/proposals/return-intents,
arrays should be returned or yielded by reference, unless the function has
the 'out' return intent (to be implemented).

TODO: need a similar test for a proc (i.e. for returning arrays, rather
than yielding them).

TODO: need a similar test for yielding/returning domains.
