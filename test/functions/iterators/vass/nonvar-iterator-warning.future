feature request: compiler to detect when an iterator should be marked 'var'

Motivation: I hit this (several times) when writing leader/follower iterators.
My follower iterator over an array was not marked 'var' but there was
no diagnostics to warn me that I needed to add 'var'.

The compiler could issue a warning "did you mean it to be a 'var' iterator?"
upon encountering the following case:
- a for/forall/... loop with an index variable and an iterable expression
  ('lval' and 'myiter()' in this test)
- the iteratable expression in the loop is a non-var iterator
- there is an assignment to the index variable
- the index variable is never read following the assignment
  (i.e. it is a dead assignment; only fire if it is guaranteed to be dead)
