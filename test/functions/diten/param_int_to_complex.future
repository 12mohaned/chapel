bug: function with param formal chosen, cannot coerce actual at compile time

The overloaded function foo has two versions. One takes a param complex, the
other a non-param complex. A param int is passed to foo, and the param complex
version is chosen. However, a compile time int->complex coercion is not
supported, so the non-param version of foo should be chosen instead.
