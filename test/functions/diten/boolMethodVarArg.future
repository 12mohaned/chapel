bug: varargs function causes method over bools to be ambiguous

The varargs argument to function f is making the bool method call ambiguous;
there are mymethod methods for each bool size and we aren't resolving the call
to the correctly sized one. Copying the argument into a temp before calling
the bool method works:

var t = args(i);
t.mymethod();
