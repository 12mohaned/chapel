bug: function with param formal chosen, cannot coerce actual at compile time

The overloaded function foo has two versions. One takes a param real, the
other a non-param real. A param int is passed to foo, and the param real
version is chosen. However, a compile time int->real coercion is not
supported, so the non-param version of foo should be chosen instead.
