feature request: restore varargs capability to initializers on generic types

In making the switch over to unify generic and concrete types with initializers,
this test regressed.  I believe it is because there was previously an error with
varargs for concrete types that hadn't been exposed.  I'm going to fix that
independent of this change, so hopefully it won't fail for long.
