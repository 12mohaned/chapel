semantic: expected behavior and use of intents with param functions

This test tries to utilize the out intent with a param function.  The result is
that the values stored in the function's arguments are not copied back to the
variables sent to the function as one would expect when using an out intent.

Do we expect out, inout, and ref intents to be valid for param functions?  If
not, we should generate an error or warning for this test.  If we do expect them
to be valid, then the param function should give the same result as the version
that is not param.  The .good file reflects the latter scenario.
