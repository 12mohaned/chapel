semantic: can we support 'setter' in var-iterators?

Notes from 04/30/08 meeting
---------------------------
* the challenge here is that if an iterator is captured into 
  index variables, the uses of those variables are far enough
  from the iterator that it can be difficult to judge whether
  the iterator is used in gett or setter mode.  For this reason,
  Steve suggests "no, it cannot be."

* Decided to keep this around and defer until we have more
  experience with zippered parallel iterators, sparse, etc.
  and maybe make a better call on the reference semantics
  of index variables in iterator invocations.
