bug: internal error on non-foldable where clauses

In this function, we attempt to replace 'x' with '1.2:uint(8)' which
can't be folded, so then we hit an internal error because downstream
code assumes that this will be a symbol or something like that?  Yet
we should never even consider this function as a candidate due to its
actual argument list.
