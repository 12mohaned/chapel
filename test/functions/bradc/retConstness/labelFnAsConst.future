feature request: const functions

We support param, var, and type functions.  I'd argue
our default functions are const functions and that
this keyword should be allowed to be specified to
indicate that the thing being returned by the
function cannot be modified (according to normal
const rules).  Even if this isn't our default
interpretation of an unlabeled function, it ought
to be allowed to be specified.
