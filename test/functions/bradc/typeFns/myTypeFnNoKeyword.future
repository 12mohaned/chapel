bug: incorrect declaration of type function

In this test, the user has declared a type function without
the type keyword.  This seems like it could have one of two
effects:

(1) should generate an error, as with myTypeFnConstKeyword
(2) should infer that the function is a type function (in
    which case we might want to do the same for param
    functions?  In which case blank does not mean "const
    function" but rather "infer the type of the function".
    This seems attractive, but not necessary to me.
