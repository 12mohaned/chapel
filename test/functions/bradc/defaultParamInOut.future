It seems that the default parameter wrappers aren't setting
up default values for this test (though I'm pretty sure they
are for other tests such as defaultParam.chpl in the same
directory).

My concern is that even if they were, the parameters for
other arguments that aren't default won't get copied back
because the copy back statements appear after the nested 
return (defaultParam.chpl's generated C code for callinout 
shows the example of this that made me start worrying).
