type inference

When the author of a function forgets to return a value, the
function is assumed to return void.  Unfortunately, it looks
like the compiler allows variables to be assigned this void
value, giving them void type.  My assumption is that we'd
instead like to say something about the function not having
a return type when trying to use its return value.
