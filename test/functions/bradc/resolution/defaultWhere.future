semantic: priority of where-less function

This semantic future suggests that a function with no where clause should
not be as attractive an option as one whose where clause is true.  Given
the functions shown here, it seems reasonable that the final of the four
combinations should be selected if neither of the other three matches
(and it does), but unfortunately it also results in an ambiguity when
either of the other three matches, essentially making the first three
functions useless since there is no way to call them.  We discussed this
at lunch today.
