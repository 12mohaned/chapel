var fn semantics

My sense is that one shouldn't be able to return a
local from a var function.  If this is accurate,
we should generate an error message for this test.
I've put in a sample error message, but I suspect
we may want to use a different wording.  (We
actually do currently generate an error message, but
it's a poor one).
