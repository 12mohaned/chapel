The problem with this test is that __init_internal_prelude,
__init_prelude and the other file/module init functions are
not visible in the scope which they are called from.

The function which determines this is AInfo::visible_functions
in analysis.cpp.  It is controlled with --scoping.
If Steve or Brad could take a look at this I would be most
appreciative.
