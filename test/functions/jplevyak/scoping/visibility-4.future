I fixed the below problem.  It is now a visibility issue but what
should happen, and the .good has two writelns, but the program only

I believe we decided to go with declared subtyping of records.
Also, I believe that the more general nested function should subsume.
Whether this should be taken care of in visibility or in dispatch
is another question.
