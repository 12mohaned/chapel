The problem with this one is that Tuple is a class,
not a TupleType.  In order to make the change
we need to be able to create methods on TupleType's
so that the tuple indexing function can be built
in internal_prelude.chpl.   Alternatively, tuple
indexing could be auto-built along with the other
setters, getters.
