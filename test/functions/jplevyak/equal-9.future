there is now an option for it to do so and to make
the = operator be a bound member.  Unfortunately
there are issues with Tuples and Arrays.

Also, it tries to reresolve the newly inserted BinOp..
probably need use get_ast_children to control recursion.

ResolveSymbols doesn't seem to call resolve_binary_operator on
assignment.  I added a comment next to a line that should be removed,
but then a function isn't found every time.  For example, when the
assignment LHS is a MemberAccess and requires a setter.  There are a
few other cases in this example.

When the user provides an over-loaded = for a
record we shoudn't generate another one.
