error message: this() function resolving to domain's this() function (?)

In this test, the this() method that I've provided is incorrect
in that it tries to index into an array indexed using int(32)'s
with an int(64) value -- clearly a problem on my part.  The
strange thing is that the error message I get seems to believe
that I've indexed into a domain -- I'm not seeing why this
would happen (and in any case, it seems like we should generate
a better error message for the user here).
