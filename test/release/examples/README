Chapel Examples Directory and Testing System
============================================

This directory contains several Chapel example codes:

     genericStack.chpl      : a stack class written using generic-programming
     hpcc06/                : our code for the 2006 HPC Challenge competition
       probSize.chpl        : a common module for computing problem sizes
       stream.chpl          : our global STREAM Triad entry
       ra.chpl              : our global Random Access entry
       ra-randstream.chpl   : the random stream generator for our RA entry
       fft.chpl             : our global 1D FFT entry
       fft-mta.chpl         : a port of the 2005 Konecny, Kahan, Feo entry
       tree_construct.chpl  : construct and walk a tree in parallel
       prod-cons.chpl       : producer-consumer using a sync variable


--------------------------------
Files related to the test system
--------------------------------

In addition to the codes themselves, it contains files used by our
regression testing infrastructure to automatically compile, run, and
test sample codes.  For a test foo.chpl, the following files may be
used:

     foo.compopts   : command-line options to be used when compiling the test
     foo.execopts   : command-line options to be used when executing the test
     foo.good       : the expected output for the test
     foo.notest     : indicates that foo.chpl should not be tested


---------------------
Using the test system
---------------------

To launch the test system, cd into this directory and use:

     start_test

which will cause all of the tests in this directory to be compiled and
executed, printing out a summary at the end and creating log files of
the test run in a Logs/ subdirectory.  Some other useful ways to run
the test system are:

     start_test -startdir <dir>
     start_test -onetest <foo.chpl>

which run the test system starting from a single directory, or on a
single test, respectively.  For a list of other test system options,
use:

     start_test -help

And for complete documentation on the testing system, refer to the
comments at the top of the start_test file.
