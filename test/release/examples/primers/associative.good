An empty associative domain: {}

A populated associative domain of strings: {Dana, Alice, Frank, Clark, Bob, Ellen}

Removed 'Bob' and 'Frank', added 'Robert': {Dana, Alice, Clark, Robert, Ellen}

Our 'Scores' associative array: 0 0 0 0 0
Our 'Scores' array, pretty-printed: [ Alice => 0, Clark => 0, Dana => 0, Ellen => 0, Robert => 0 ]

Our 'Scores' array initialized with some values: [ Alice => 42, Clark => 100, Dana => 91, Ellen => 100, Robert => 33 ]

The average score is 73

Our updated 'Scores' array after adding some more names: [ Alice => 42, Clark => 100, Dana => 91, Ellen => 100, Gary => 10, John => 76, Robert => 33 ]

Some primes in the fibonnaci sequence: {5, 13, 3, 2}
Some primes not in the fibonnaci sequence: {7, 17, 11}

Women = {Dana, Alice, Ellen}
Men = {John, Gary, Clark, Robert, Mark}

Who had a passing grade?
	[ Alice => false, Clark => true, Dana => true, Ellen => true, Gary => false, John => true, Mark => true, Nancy => false, Robert => false ]

Which numbers are in the fibonnaci sequence?
	[ 0 => true, 1 => true, 2 => true, 3 => true, 5 => true, 7 => false, 8 => true, 11 => false, 13 => true, 17 => false ]
