Chapel 2006 HPC Challenge Codes
===============================

This directory contains our entries for the 2006 HPC Challenge
competition, class 2 (http://www.hpcchallenge.org).  For a detailed
explanation of these benchmarks, please refer to hpcc06.pdf in the
doc/ directory.  

As our compiler has improved, we have removed workarounds in these
codes that were noted using "Compiler Status Notes" in the paper.  For
example, when the paper was written, iterator return types could not
be inferred.  Now that they can be, the explicitly declared types have
been removed to match the style for the rest of the codes.

This directory also contains a Makefile to help build the benchmarks.
