Chapel implementation of LULESH
===============================

This directory contains a Chapel port of the DARPA/Livermore
Unstructured Lagrangian Explicit Shock Hydrodynamics (LULESH)
benchmark (see https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/ShockHydro/
for details).

Status

The Chapel version of LULESH is a work-in-progress.  To the best of
our knowledge, the current form is a complete and faithful
implementation of LULESH.  That said, several improvements remain
to improve performance and elegance.  See the list below and TODO
comments in the source code for some known areas for improvement.
