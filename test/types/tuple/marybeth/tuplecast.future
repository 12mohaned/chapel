semantic: expand value into tuple

Notes from 04/30/08 meeting
---------------------------
* con: we can write this using a fill function today.

* pro: may want other similar cases; casting scalar
       to array; casting value to string to get
       formatting.  Argue that for these simple
       cases a cast is more intuitive for someone
       who's facile with the language than looking
       up a function with a vague name (and more
       convenient than defining it themselves).

       That said, fine with retiring this for today
       and waiting until the need returns again.

Previously:
-----------

sjd: I proposed doing this by writing

  (x...3)

which would be interpreted as

  (x, x, x)

and unifies the syntax of expanding tuples.

Given t = (x, x, x) it is the case that

  (...t)

is expanded out to

  x, x, x

Alternatively, we can prototype a function

  fill(x, 3)

or something like that.

This test is wrong as written because : binds tighter than *
so it would need to be x:(3*real)



feature request:  scalar-to-homogeneous-tuple cast

It would be helpful to have a way to cast a scalar value
to a homogeneous tuple since there is no scalar promotion
for tuples.
