bug: when querying the type of the tuple in a variable length
argument list, a tuple type is given, not the type of the tuple
elements

In this test, 

def norm(x:?t...?n) {
  var sum: t;
  for i in 1..n {
    sum += x(i)*2;
  }
  return sqrt(sum);
}

t is a n*t homogeneous tuple.  The test fails because there isn't a sqrt
function that takes tuple types as input, so it fails to compile.

This doesn't seem correct to me.  If I were to specify the type of a 
tuple in the above example, I would write:

def norm(x:real...?n) {
  var sum: real;
...
}

So, when querying the type of x (as in the first definition of norm), 
I would expect it to return the type of the elements of the tuple, 
not a tuple type.
