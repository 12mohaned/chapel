bug: first-class homogeneous tuple types

This is similar to homogTupleArr, except that it uses
heterogeneous tuple syntax, which is working much better.
In fact, the one test that fails here is the one that
uses an array element type that is a homogeneous tuple
of heterogeneous tuples.  See homogTupleArr.future for
more details.
