error message: no tuple iterators

I mis-typed this program, thinking I was declaring an anonymous
array of strings, when in fact I was declaring a tuple of strings.
The error message was confusing, though -- it complains about
there not being a these iterator for strings, when it should
instead complain about not having an iterator for tuples (and
preferably in a way that was targeted to this case and not a
generic unresolved call error).
