feature request: general support for homogenous tuple types

I would like a homogeneous tuple type to be used anywhere
that a type should legally appear.  This test demonstrates
many different possibilities.  It could be that the
parenthesized version should be illegal.

(Brad would like all of these to be supported, by
switching to a different syntax for homogeneous
tuples (and similarly to introduce a "new" keyword
for creating new class instancess) so that types
and expressions aren't as ambiguous as they are now).
