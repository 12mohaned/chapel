homogeneous tuple syntax

Homogeneous tuple syntax doesn't seem to be working as I (or, I think
Steve) had expected.  I think this has been a known fragility in the
parser for some time now.  This test demonstrates some of it.

Not all of these forms may be correct.  Just trying to establish which
are and which aren't.
