semantic: arrays in tuples

It's no longer clear to me what the semantics of arrays in
tuples should be, both at construction time and when passing
them to a function.  I think Steve's got a good intuition
based on recent 590o email discussions, but wanted to capture
this test and question while I had code showing it off.
