deitz/bradc/??? -- low priority

This isn't an important test for SSCA2, but is one I came up
with while thinking about other things the other day, and seemed
worth capturing.

This test probably won't work until we capture the default
initializer of a user type into a variable -- I believe we
currently re-generate the call for each variable 
initialization.

Currently, it doesn't work because for some reason readDefaultVal
is having trouble being resolved.
