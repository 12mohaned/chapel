bug: redefining built-in types causes internal error

This test results in:

redefineTypeNames2.chpl:1: In function 'main':
redefineTypeNames2.chpl:4: error: SymExpr::var::defPoint is not in AST [expr.cpp:228]

I'm not thoroughly sure whether it should be a correct test or not --
the question depends on the relationship between the int and int(n)
types.  Does redefining int imply something about the int(n) types, or
are these separate symbols somehow?  Either an error message or
working code would be fine with me -- just no internal error.
