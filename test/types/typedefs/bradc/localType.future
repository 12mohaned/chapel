bradc/??? -- low priority

This isn't an important test for SSCA2, but is one I came up
with while thinking about other things the other day, and seemed
worth capturing.

This test currently isn't working because we insert nested
I/O functions for the local type, but prototype them in the
header file where the type myfoointeger isn't available.
This would either need to be handled by (1) squelching the
I/O functions (do we need them?), (2) handling nested
functions better, (3) prototyping types in the header file,
...?
