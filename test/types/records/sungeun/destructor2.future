error message: The cast to object type in chpl_here_free() is encountered 
before we attempt to call free on it, so the "invalid cast" error fires first.

This is due to having replaced the call to chpl_mem_free with chpl_here_free(), 
and the fact that the call to chpl_track_free occurs before the call to free.

The cure is to run this semantic check earlier and remove it from resolution.
(Resolution should only report resolution related errors.)
