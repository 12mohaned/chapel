bug: Verify error. Generated calls to autoCopy functions do not insert reference temps.

Ref temp insertion is performed during resolution, but not in later passes
(e.g. parallel).  So if the autoCopy funciton takes an argument by reference
there will be a mismatch.

Reference levels are adjusted in the backend, so this mismatch only shows up
when verification is enabled.
