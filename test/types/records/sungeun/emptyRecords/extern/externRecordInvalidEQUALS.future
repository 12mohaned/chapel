bug: == between an empty extern record and an integer (non-record) compiles correctly and always returns true

== gets built in build_record_equality_function().  The second arg is
dtAny to handle sub-records, so the function gets instantiated during
resolution with int.

Not sure exactly what should happen in this case.
