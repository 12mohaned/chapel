bug: copy init not resolving in this example

A copy initializer declared as a proc init(other:MyRecord) should resolve
and work for both instances where the compiler wants to add an initCopy
and when it wants to add an autoCopy.  In particular, certain operations
on records can cause callDestructors to add an autoCopy, such as
returning a global by value.
