bug: initializers with default args not considered as copy initializers

This test shows that if an initializer exists that can be called in
the "copy initializer" context, but relies on default arguments, it is
not considered.  It seems to me that this should work.  Otherwise, it
requires the user to split the initializer into two versions, as shown
in copyWithDefaultArgs-workaround.chpl
