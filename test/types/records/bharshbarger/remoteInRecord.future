bug: remote records pass by 'in' intent made local before copying.

This test fails in an initCopy for the 'foo' record. The local-field
optimization is applied to the formal 'x' in 'bar' because in the generated C
code 'x' is not wide. 'x' is not wide because the struct representing 'a' is
copied locally before being passed into the function.

The initCopy is the first thing to happen inside the generated C code for 'bar'.
Should it take the wide reference of 'a' first?
