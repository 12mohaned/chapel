bug: should be able to init arrays of records of const fields

This test demonstrates that arrays of records that have const fields
can't be initialized, though it seems that they should be able to.  As
Mike points out, the zeroth order concern here is that we can't create
array literals of record values with const fields as
arrOfRecConstField.chpl shows.
