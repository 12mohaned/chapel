bug: cplx.re.type generates C compiler warning

cplx.re.type generates a call to the extern creal function that does not
capture the return value.  This causes a warning from clang.  Instead, .type
should cause the entire expression to not be evaluated, and be replaced by
the expected type at compile time.
