I expected that x = (1.0,1.0):complex(64) would cast the tuple to a 64 bit
complex data type.  However, the compiler hits an internal error when compiling
this.

If this cast shouldn't be allowed, then there should be a better error 
message and clear documentation about how to cast tuples to complex numbers.
