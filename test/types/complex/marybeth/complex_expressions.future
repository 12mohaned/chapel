Do we intend to support the evaluation of expressions to
complex variables when the expression doesn't contain any
complex variables?  That means that we would have to change the
evaluation of a negative sqrt root from a nan to an imaginary
number.  Matlab can handle this case.

Do we intend to support coercions in complex expressions?
Currently, the compiler can handle c = 1 + 6.0i but not
c = 1.0 + 6i.  Is there a reason why we don't want to do the
latter?
