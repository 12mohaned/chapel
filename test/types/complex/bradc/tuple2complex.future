complex cast

This test casts floating point tuples into
complexes of various widths and via a user
type symbol.  Currently, complex casting
only works for pure "complex" types which
seems inconsistent with how other types
work.

When we get this working, the FFT code that
we submitted for HPCC can be improved.
