This is an interesting ambiguity in an attempt to index into a sequence of strings with an arithmetic sequence.  Since strings supporting indexing directly with arithmetic sequences, there is an ambiguity between the scalar promotions.

One solution is to define indexing with an arithmetic sequence directly on a sequence and doing the same for one-dimensional arrays.
