feature request: math operators on ranges

This test captures two semantic questions that also come 
up in test/arrays/bradc/paulslice*.chpl:

1) Should ops on arithmetic sequences result in arithmetic
   sequences? (I'd like to believe "yes", so wrote the .good
   that way)

2) Should multiplying an arithmetic sequence by a scalar
   be interpreted as simply multiplying the bounds, or as
   multiplying the elements in the original sequence (i.e.,
   similar to a "by" clause)?  The current implementation is
   the latter, so I did the same in my .good file.
