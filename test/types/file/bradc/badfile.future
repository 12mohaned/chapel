It appears that when using fwrite(), the first symbol does not attempt
to be resolved, presumably due to our rewrites in normalize.  This use
of fwrite() is also bogus since it only has a file argument.  We
should either:

* rewrite it to be some sort of no-op (like:
  "fwrite(thisVariableDoesntExist, "")") 
  which should cause the symbol to be resolved;
  
* or translate it into a bogus call:
  "fwrite(thisVariableDoesntExist)
  which would cause a function dispatch problem

* or generate a compile-time error message like:
  "fwrite called with fewer than 2 arguments"

Of the three approaches, I like the second one.
