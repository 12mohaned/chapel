What should the semantics be.  Since we can coerce an integer to a
float, it seems that should apply to this test case.  Currently, it
looks like the field becomes an integer like the value passed to x
rather than the type passed to t.

is this code legal?  if it is it doesn't work.
if it isn't, how should we report the error?
