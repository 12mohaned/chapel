I have put a simple implementation of Type::instantiate_generic
in place which is sufficient for this test case.
I have also made a stub for FnSymbol::instantiate_generic
which currently returns NULL.  This causes these
two test cases to SEGV.  The implementation (which 
I am leaving to Steve) should be a modification
of FnSymbol::clone() (or perhaps a call to a shared
produced).
