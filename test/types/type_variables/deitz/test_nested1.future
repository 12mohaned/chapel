For this example, for "bar", getVisibleFunctions() called with "bar"
from:

(CallExpr
  (SymExpr 'bar:_unknownType')
  (SymExpr "hello world" '_literal_210:string'))

is returning 0.   

Even if that was not the case it would still fail since the new
functions are not in the dispatch tables.


HISTORY

nested functions in instantiated function are not visible
