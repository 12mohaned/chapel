I think that this test is now working but the
.good file is incorrect.   integers have a standard
coercion into strings which supersedes the default.


HISTORY

For this example, for "bar", getVisibleFunctions() called with "bar"
from:

(CallExpr
  (SymExpr 'bar:_unknownType')
  (SymExpr "hello world" '_literal_210:string'))

is returning 0.   

Even if that was not the case it would still fail since the new
functions are not in the dispatch tables.


HISTORY

nested functions in instantiated function are not visible
