If you uncomment the #define CLONE 1
at the top of analysis/clone.cpp this
code will crash because TypeDefStmt::clone
is trying to clone all the statements below
the type and not just the type.   We may
need to change the interface or have a
new interface, in any case I can make
the new call when it becomes available.

I am assigning this to deitz/jplevyak
until we get this clone/members thing
resolved since Steve and I need to work
it out.
