OK, I took a look at the results with ANALYSIS_MATCH turned on, and 
they look correct to me.  We get one "warning" at line 78, but that
is for "f" being set to a cloned type (which it should be), and
we get one warning at line 112 which is the return type of the cloned
construct_foo function which is now returning the new cloned type
(whioch it should be).


HISTORY
=======


Uncommenting ANALYSIS_MATCH in findUnknownTypes.cpp, many types seem to be resolved in ways I would'nt expect.  The types for the member functions of the cloned classes are left Unresolved.

The problem here is that classes have already been cloned, but 
the original class (from which the clones were derived) still
exists in the AST via the TypeDefStmt.  Like unused functions
there will be unused types which should not be resolved.

If you need an interface to query which types are actually
used in the program, ask me.
