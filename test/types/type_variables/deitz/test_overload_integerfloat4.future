This is the first test case which uses wrappers.
In this case the wrapper is doing the coersion
of an integer to a float. 

I have stubbed out the general build code
using the interface I proposed in stmt.h.

It is likely that when it is implemented I will
have some work to do as well, so I (jplevyak)
have put Steve and my name on this.
