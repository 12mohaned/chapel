bug: ambiguously-aligned ranges are printed with 'align 0'

Note: this bug is exposed (but arguably not introduced) by the commit
that adds this .future file.
Note: there is likely another .future for the same bug.

E.g. the range (-1.. by -2), which is ambiguously aligned
(regardless of the aforementioned commit),
is printed as "-1.. by -2 align 0".
