semantic: implicit floating point parameter coercion

sjd: If we allow parameter real(64) to be implicitly coerced to real(32),
since we don't allow folding over any operators, this wouldn't apply
to any kind of expression.  So

  var r: real(32) = +2.4;

would still not work.  I'm not opposed to this tact though.  What does
C# do?  Do they have real(16) if real(32) is their default?

-----------

Unlike integers, floating point literals are not implicitly coerced
down to smaller floating point sizes, implying that the initialization
of a real(32) requires a cast.  I believe that it would be appropriate
to the spirit of Chapel to permit this.  If not, I think we need to
reconsider whether our default floating point width should be 32 bits
to support this case.
