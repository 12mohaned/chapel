feature request: implicit floating point parameter coercion

Unlike integers, floating point literals are not implicitly coerced
down to smaller floating point sizes, implying that the initialization
of a real(32) requires a cast.  I believe that it would be appropriate
to the spirit of Chapel to permit this.  If not, I think we need to
reconsider whether our default floating point width should be 32 bits
to support this case.
