# Some (probably all, haven't doublechecked) linkers will refuse to create
# shared libraries when there are _any_ text relocations present.
# The reason being that if you have a text relocation, it means that your
# shared library isn't fully position independent. If your SO isn't PIC, then
# indepedent processes can't share a single copy of its text segment.
# Not to mention that it makes dynamic linking more expensive in general.
