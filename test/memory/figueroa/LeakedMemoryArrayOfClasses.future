bug: This is a duplicate of test/functions/deitz/nested/test_nested_var_iterator2.future

See LeakedMemory5.future for details.

To duplicate this bug:
  Compile with --savec option and run gdb on a.out.
  In the savec directory, open DSIUtil.c and set a breakpoint on _breakLabel.
  Set a breakpoint on the preceding line.
  set args --memTrack
  run
  Observe that you have reached the label without reaching the free on the preceding line.
  Therefore, _ic_2 (72 bytes) is leaked.
