bug: Inclusiion of associative array/domain literals somehow breaks this test.

It seems this test relies on an optimization which promotes an array which
contains a signle range into just a range.   This is no longer occuring as the
type of the domain is now treated as associative. 

As it was unclear what the proper behaviour should be, it was decided to not
block the associative array mod and instead convert this failing test to a 
future.
