bug: associative array infinite loop (bradc)

Something must be wrong with the quadratic probing
implementation -- at some point it keeps checking
the same location over and over again.  It's
written with an infinite loop, but should be
rewritten to use a for loop since the number of
probes is bounded by the table size.
