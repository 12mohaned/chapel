==============================================
These things regularly cause noise in testing:
==============================================

extern/bradc/emptyRecords/emptyrecordexternfn
---------------------------------------------
I wouldn't call this noise per say, but it's been a passing future for
a while, and I think someone (maybe Brad?) should look at retiring it
or adding skipifs (if needed).

   Future (bug: pruning of empty records and externs) [Success matching program output for extern/bradc/emptyRecords/emptyrecordexternfn]


spectralnorm (vass)
-------------------
proposed approach is to see whether reference version is similarly
noisy, and if not to see whether ours has inadvertant nondeterminisms.


madness (sungeun)
-----------------
*** Resolved after 7/7/12 changes to gasnet testing configuration?
*** johnk: Consider removing next week if it doesn't show up again by
*** the end of the week.
Sung's been working on dialing down parallelism to avoid timeouts
in oversubscribed setting, but it's not yet perfect: test_likepy
timed out 06/05/12.


ra* (gbt)
---------
Greg plans to remove races from the verification loop on the theory
that if we're barely/occasionally failing, removing errors introduced
due to races here should take us below the threshold.


lulesh (bradc)
--------------
Seems like it still times out occasionally in the release version;
need to diagnose whether it's nondeterministic deadlock/livelock
or whether we're just running close to the threshold of the timeout.


cray-xt-cray (diten)
--------------------
When the Chapel compiler is built with cray-xt-cray, we get
nondeterministic failures that have not been investigated.  One
question would be whether turning optimizations off/down when building
'chpl' would make these go away.


linux64.gnu.gasnet.qthreads.none (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------------------------
1) Continue to have a lot of noise in testing.
   - Often the execution times out nondeterministically
2) Got a seg fault (06/06/12, 6/16)
3) Intermitent seg fault on exit (7/7 7/9, 7/12, 7/13, same as #2?)
4) seg fault during program execution (same as #2?):
   distributions/robust/arithmetic/optimizations/optimizeOnClauses_basic_tuple (7/10)
   release/examples/spec/Classes/delete (7/12)
5) The following showed up a while ago, but doesn't seem to be
   documented:

   warning: inlining failed in call to 'atomic_destroy_int_least64_t': --param large-function-growth limit reached

   Seen with SSCA2, lulesh, distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/hpl


valgrind (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------
*** It's a little difficult to follow the trend since we only run this
*** once a week, so only the last log file is preserved.  We should
*** considering saving the logs week-over-week (which we should
*** probably do for all the tests too since we have the space to).
1) Nondeterministic "the impossible has happened" failures
2) Nondeterministic timeouts (could raise timeout value even further)


xmt build (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------
Every night, first XMT compile fails; second one succeeds.  Is there
any chance that this is due to a leftover program library of some
sort?  If not, file bug against XMT compiler.


variance in comm counts - linux64.gnu.gasnet-everything.fifo.pthreads (sungeun)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
examples:
 performance/sungeun/multilocale/syncsingle  (06/17/12, 6/21)
 - FYI, I did not see during (7/7-7/13)


parallel/cobegin/diten/cobeginRace (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------------------------------------
"timedexec died with signal 11" - pgi compiler (06/18/12)
unknown cause - baseline (06/17/12)


non-deterministic timeouts with gasnet (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------------------------------
The following configurations are affected:
 linux64.gnu.gasnet.qthreads.none
 linux64.gnu.gasnet.fifo.pthreads.tcmalloc
 linux64.gnu.gasnet-fast.fifo.pthreads.dlmalloc
 linux64.gnu.gasnet-everything.fifo.pthreads
examples of what times out:
 release/examples/benchmarks/ssca2/SSCA2_main (ALWAYS: sungeun on it)
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/hpl (maybe resolved?)
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/stress/test_many_array (maybe resolved?)
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/jacobi (still timing out 7/7-7/13)
 distributions/nelson/MultiBlockDist2DLocales (maybe resolved?)
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/modules/test_module_Sort (maybe resolved?)
 etc.


"in routine alloca() there is a stack overflow" under PGI (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Somewhat? nondeterministic.
These configurations:
 linux64.pgi.none.fifo.pthreads
 xt-cle.cray-xt-pgi.none.fifo.pthreads
 xt-cle.cray-xt-pgi.none.fifo.pthreads--linux64.gnu


==================================================
Not so noisy as to be instantly recognizable (yet)
==================================================

minus_equals nondeterminism (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------------------------
noted in regressions (week of 07/02)

atomics nondeterminisms (UNASSIGNED)
------------------------------------
program release/examples/primers/atomics (06/30/12:xt-intel, 07/04/12:linux32)

----------------------------------------------

test_module_Sort (06/06/12, 6/16)
test_array_slicing3 (06/08/12, 6/16)

memory/vass/crash-memory-module-1 (vass)
----------------------------------------
fails intermittently
