==============================================
These things regularly cause noise in testing:
==============================================

spectralnorm (vass)
-------------------
proposed approach is to see whether reference version is similarly
noisy, and if not to see whether ours has inadvertant nondeterminisms.


madness (sungeun)
-----------------
Sung's been working on dialing down parallelism to avoid timeouts
in oversubscribed setting, but it's not yet perfect: test_likepy
timed out 06/05/12


ra* (gbt)
---------
Greg plans to remove races from the verification loop on the theory
that if we're barely/occasionally failing, removing errors introduced
due to races here should take us below the threshold.


lulesh (bradc)
--------------
1) Brad made changes this week that should stabilize Sung's version of
   lulesh
2) there are likely still timeouts on the release version that should
   be investigated.
3) causes an internal error in xmt (though perhaps not a noisy one?)


cray-xt-cray (UNASSIGNED)
-------------------------
When the Chapel compiler is built with cray-xt-cray, we get
nondeterministic failures that have not been investigated.  One
question would be whether turning optimizations off/down when building
'chpl' would make these go away.


qthreads (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------
1) Continue to have a lot of noise in testing.
2) Some comm counts off, got a seg fault (06/06/12)


valgrind (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------
1) Nondeterministic "the impossible has happened" failures
2) Nondeterministic timeouts (could raise timeout value even further)


xmt build (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------
Every night, first XMT compile fails; second one succeeds.  Is there
any chance that this is due to a leftover program library of some
sort?  If not, file bug against XMT compiler.



==================================================
Not so noisy as to be instantly recognizable (yet)
==================================================

gasnet-everything nondeterminisms (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------------------------------
MultiBlockDist2DLocales (06/05/12)
test_module_Sort (06/06/12)
test_array_slicing3 (06/08/12)


no-local nondeterminisms (UNASSIGNED)
-------------------------------------
cg-sparse-timecomp (06/05/12)



======================================================
Older stuff that I didn't see creating noise this week
======================================================

============================================================
linux64.pgi.none.fifo.pthreads
============================================================
This seems noisy, or not yet ready for primetime.  Add to REGRESSIONS?
[Error matching program output for studies/lulesh/sungeun/lulesh (compopts: 1)]
Newly added this week, but fails also for the standard implementation. Add to REGRESSIONS.

============================================================
Perf linux64.gnu.none.fifo.pthreads
============================================================
Warnings from createGraphs should be eliminated because they are counted as errors.
Bug -> Vass.
