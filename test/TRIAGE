classes/vass/generic-method-with-param-arg-4
parsing/vass/undefined-backslash-combos-in-strings-1
users/ferguson/extern_class_test
  linux64.gnu.none.fifo.pthreads-nlc (2012-10-05)
  New failing future, due to re-enabling -Werror
  David looked at these.  The problem was already there, but now the expected
  compile time warning is an error and so we have a mismatch.

cray-prgenv-pgi (many failures)
  David looked at this.  They are old failures shown as new because the name
  changed from cray-xe-pgi to cray-prgenv-pgi.

extern/bradc/copyExternRecord/extern_test
  linux64.gnu.none.fifo.pthreads-npt (2012-10-05)
  New failing test, due to re-enabling -Werror
  Brad looked at this.  The problem was already there, but now the expected
  compile time warning is an error and so we have a mismatch.

prgenv-gnu compiler build problem in chpbld01, chpbld02
  (2012-10-05)
  Sung looked at this.  It is due to "defined but not used" warnings that
  become errors when -Werror is present.

release/examples/spec/Generics/constructorsForGenericFields
release/examples/spec/Generics/fieldWithoutType
release/examples/spec/Generics/genericStack
  cray-xt.cray-prgenv-cray.none.fifo.pthreads-exm (2012-10-05)
  Greg looked at this.  These failed because the compiler couldn't get a
  CLE license.  The problem seems to have been just a temporary glitch;
  compilations before and after these tests (which were successive) worked
  fine.

studies/ssca2/performance/SSCA2_commDiags
  linux64.gnu.gasnet-everything.fifo.pthreads-std (2012-10-02)
  Sung has this one.  It looks to me (gbt) like the comm diags ranges just
  need to be wider.

These things regularly cause noise in testing:
==============================================

madness (sungeun)
-----------------
Sung's been working on dialing down parallelism to avoid timeouts
in oversubscribed setting, but it's not yet perfect: test_likepy
timed out 06/05/12.
- Added a .timeout file for test_likepy (sungeun: 8/29/2012)

ra* (gbt)
---------
Greg committed a fix to resolve the race in the main version (r20301),
and now just needs to propagate it to the other versions, as well as
to the else-clause of the 'useOn' conditional.
New information (10/3/12): the "random" indices are strongly skewed toward
the bottom of the index range (1/4th of the table updates are to the 0'th
element), which makes conflicting updates far more common than they should
be.
  release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc/variants/ra-cleanloop: fixed by r20326
  studies/hpcc/2008/ra: not fixed yet, failed 8/14/12
  studies/hpcc/nodistrib/ra.nodist: should have been fixed by 20333 (8/14/12),
    not fixed yet, failed 8/18/12, 9/{16,17,21,30}/12.
  studies/hpcc/RA/bradc/parallel/ra-dist: not fixed yet, last failure unknown

lulesh (bradc)
--------------
Times out sometimes in XMT testing, but seems to have stabilized in
other cases.

TooManyThreads (unassigned)
---------------------------
Fails periodically.  Lately observed pthreads.tcmalloc (2012/08/15).

mutilocale/deitz/needMultiLocales/diagnostics/test_private_broadcast_large
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Succeeded: 9/23 (64ggffpd)
  Failed: 10/4 (linux64.gnu.gasnet-fast.fifo.pthreads.dlmalloc)

linux64.gnu.gasnet.qthreads.none (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------------------------
0) We moved to a non-oversubscribed setting on a beefier machine
1) Continue to have a lot of noise in testing.
   - Often the execution times out nondeterministically
2) Got a seg fault (06/06/12, 6/16, stream-ep 8/23/12)
3) Intermitent seg fault on exit (7/7 7/9, 7/12, 7/13, same as #2?)
4) seg fault during program execution (same as #2?):
   distributions/robust/arithmetic/optimizations/optimizeOnClauses_basic_tuple (7/10)
   release/examples/spec/Classes/delete (7/12)

baseline (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------
distributions/nelson/MultiBlockDist2DLocales
studies/shootout/mandelbrot/mandelbrot-fancy (alternates between timing out and error matching program output)

valgrind (sungeun)
------------------
*** It's a little difficult to follow the trend since we only run this
*** once a week, so only the last log file is preserved.  We should
*** considering saving the logs week-over-week (which we should
*** probably do for all the tests too since we have the space to).
1) Nondeterministic "the impossible has happened" failures
   2012/08/13 -- Only one test case failed: MultiBlockDist2DLocales

   8/30/12: Passed --numThreadsPerLocale=100 to all tests to try and
   avoid VG_N_THREADS error that is causing all the impossible errors.

2) Nondeterministic timeouts (could raise timeout value even further)
   8/30/12: Timed out when running start_test by hand (versus in
   parallel as the nightly does), so I don't think it's worth
   disabling parallel testing for the sake of the time outs.

xmt build (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------
Every night, first XMT compile fails; second one succeeds.  Is there
any chance that this is due to a leftover program library of some
sort?  If not, file bug against XMT compiler.

compflags/ferguson/sub_test
---------------------------
chpbld02 has /tmp mounted on /ptmp.  The path search in findProgramPath appears
to be finding chpl in /ptmp instead of /tmp even though the /ptmp directory
it is finding is not in path. The /ptmp path it is finding is actually the
same directory as the /tmp directory it is looking for.

=========================================
Not so noisy as to be familiar annoyances
=========================================

parallel/cobegin/diten/cobeginRace (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------------------------------------
"timedexec died with signal 11" - pgi compiler (06/18/12)
unknown cause - baseline (06/17/12)

non-deterministic timeouts with gasnet (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------------------------------
The following configurations are affected:
 linux64.gnu.gasnet.qthreads.none
 linux64.gnu.gasnet.fifo.pthreads.tcmalloc
 linux64.gnu.gasnet-fast.fifo.pthreads.dlmalloc
 linux64.gnu.gasnet-everything.fifo.pthreads
examples of what times out:
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/jacobi (still timing out 10/4/12)
 distributions/nelson/MultiBlockDist2DLocales (maybe resolved?)
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/modules/test_module_Sort (maybe resolved?)
 distributions/robust/arithmetci/stress/test_many_domains (08/13)
 distributions/dm/t2 (2012/08/15)
 etc.

"in routine alloca() there is a stack overflow" under PGI (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Somewhat? nondeterministic.
These configurations:
 linux64.pgi.none.fifo.pthreads
 xt-cle.cray-xt-pgi.none.fifo.pthreads
 xt-cle.cray-xt-pgi.none.fifo.pthreads--linux64.gnu

nondet. tmalloc failures
------------------------
[Error: Timed out executing program distributions/robust/arithmetic/stress/test_many_domains] (08/08/12)

parallel/begin/deitz/test_big_recursive_begin future succeeded
--------------------------------------------------------------
*-linux64.gnu.none.fifo.pthreads-std.log (8/18,9/2,9/9,9/13/12)

  (10/2/12)
120821/Nightly-day2-Tue-linux64.gnu.none.fifo.pthreads-nlc.log

===========================================
Not noisy, but need some attention sometime
===========================================

types/range/hilde/align64
-------------------------
This test gets a false positive pass on intel and pgi it seems, for
reasons that are not clear to me (i.e., why are they behaving differently
than gcc?).  If the future should remain, a .skipif should be added to
skip it in these cases.
 
I wouldn't call the future a bug so much as a 'feature request' or
'semantic' future -- it suggests a change in the language definition
that should be considered and agreed upon rather than reflecting a way
in which the compiler is incorrect w.r.t. the language definition (as
I understand it.

xt-cle.cray-xt-cray.none.fifo.pthreads
--------------------------------------
The following compiler segfaults(?) appeared only once on 9/28/12
[Error matching compiler output for release/examples/primers/opaque]
[Error matching compiler output for release/examples/spec/Generics/fillTuple2]
[Error matching compiler output for release/examples/spec/Iterators/as-arrays]
[Error matching compiler output for release/examples/spec/Ranges/alignedNegStride]
