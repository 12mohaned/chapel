# USAGE:
#
# Current notes on triage results, sorted into the following categories:
#
# * cases that are assigned and should be fixed (ideally during the coming
#   week
#
# * cases that are causing noise regularly in testing, sorted by
#   approximate priority
#
# * cases that were once flagged as causing regular noise, but don't seem
#   so bad currently
#
# * cases that are not familiar, but have caused noise -- these are
#   noted so that if they happen again, we can move them up to an
#   earlier session and recognize a slower pattern over a longer
#   period of time
#
# * regular failures that someone might look at as part of their triage week


=========================================================
Problems analyzed and assigned that should be fixed soon:
=========================================================

studies/hpcc/RA/testRAStream (bradc)
------------------------------------
This was running too long due to a too-large problem size.  This
should stop regressing on Dec 4th, 2012.

studies/ssca2/performance/SSCA2_commDiags (sungeun)
---------------------------------------------------
  linux64.gnu.gasnet-everything.fifo.pthreads-std (2012-10-02) Sung
  has this one.  It looks to me (gbt) like the comm diags ranges just
  need to be wider.  (sungeun: 10/22/12) It's actually bounded for
  certain operations, so I'm still working on it in the background.


==============================================
These things regularly cause noise in testing:
==============================================

baseline nondeterminisms (UNASSIGNED)
-------------------------------------

we get reasonably frequent execution timeouts from a variety of tests
(listed just below); when not timing out, they fail.  We also get a
number of other baseline failures that I don't recall as being
long-standing.  It might make sense to start with one of the simplest
of the failures and see whether that sheds some light on what's going
on with the timing-out cases below.

  [Error: Timed out executing program optimizations/bulkcomm/asenjo/stencilDR/v2/stencil] (10/17/12, normally fails; succeeded 11/10/12)
  [Error: Timed out executing program studies/shootout/mandelbrot/mandelbrot-fancy] (11/14: normally fails; timed out 9/28,10/2,10/21,20/11,22/3; succeeded 9/29,10/11,11/04)
  [Error: Timed out executing program distributions/nelson/MultiBlockDist2DLocales] (11/10; normally fails)
  [Error matching program output for optimizations/bulkcomm/asenjo/ptransDR/v1/ptrans] (11/25/12)
  [Error: Timed out executing program studies/hpcc/HPL/vass/bl.md] (11/25/2012)
  [Error: Timed out executing program optimizations/bulkcomm/asenjo/stencilDR/v1/stencil]
  [Error: Timed out executing program studies/lammps/shemmy/s-lammps] (12/03/12)

sometimes the nondeterminisms are correctness vs. not-timing out as well:

  [Error matching program output for optimizations/bulkcomm/asenjo/ptransDR/v2/ptrans] (12/03/12)


linux64.gnu.gasnet.qthreads.none (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------------------------
sungeun: 10/18/12.  Things seem quieter, but not perfect
- Got a seg fault (06/06/12, 6/16, stream-ep 8/23/12)
- Intermitent seg fault on exit (7/7 7/9, 7/12, 7/13)
-  seg fault during program execution (same as as previous):
   distributions/robust/arithmetic/optimizations/optimizeOnClauses_basic_tuple (7/10)
   release/examples/spec/Classes/delete (7/12)
- Intermitent time outs:
  [Error: Timed out executing program distributions/robust/arithmetic/slicing/test_array_slicing3] (intermittent since prior to 11/25/12)
  [Error: Timed out executing program distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/jacobi] (11/26/12: intermittent since 9/17/12)
  [Error: Timed out executing program distributions/robust/arithmetic/stress/test_many_array] (11/26/12: intermittent since 9/29/12)
  [Error: Timed out executing program distributions/robust/arithmetic/stress/test_many_domains] (11/22/12: almost every day since 9/26/22)
  [Error: Timed out executing program distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/hpl (compopts: 1)] (11/28/12: likely earlier as well)


xmt build (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------
Every night, first XMT compile fails; second one succeeds.  Is there
any chance that this is due to a leftover program library of some
sort?  If not, file bug against XMT compiler.


SIGABRT on gasnet-fast runs (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------------------------
release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc/ra (compopts: 1) (10/13/12)
mutilocale/deitz/needMultiLocales/diagnostics/test_private_broadcast_large (10/11/12, 10/21/12, 12/02/12)
ra-atomics (UNASSIGNED) (10/11/12)


==============================================================================
Were once flagged as causing noise regularly, but not as familiar as the above
==============================================================================

SSCA2_main (UNASSIGNED)
-----------------------
Periodically times out for PGI (alternates between time out and stack
overflow error documented in REGRESSIONS)


TooManyThreads (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------
Fails periodically.  Lately observed pthreads.tcmalloc (2012/08/15).


mutilocale/deitz/needMultiLocales/diagnostics/test_private_broadcast_large
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Succeeded: 9/23 (64ggffpd)
  Failed: 10/4 (linux64.gnu.gasnet-fast.fifo.pthreads.dlmalloc)
  Failed (SIGABRT): 10/11/12 (")


compflags/ferguson/sub_test
---------------------------
chpbld02 has /tmp mounted on /ptmp.  The path search in findProgramPath appears
to be finding chpl in /ptmp instead of /tmp even though the /ptmp directory
it is finding is not in path. The /ptmp path it is finding is actually the
same directory as the /tmp directory it is looking for.


==========================================================================
Not so noisy as to be familiar annoyances, but worth noting to see if they
come up again
==========================================================================

===========================================
Not noisy, but need some attention sometime
===========================================

types/range/hilde/align64
-------------------------
This test gets a false positive pass on intel and pgi it seems, for
reasons that are not clear to me (i.e., why are they behaving differently
than gcc?).  If the future should remain, a .skipif should be added to
skip it in these cases.
 
I wouldn't call the future a bug so much as a 'feature request' or
'semantic' future -- it suggests a change in the language definition
that should be considered and agreed upon rather than reflecting a way
in which the compiler is incorrect w.r.t. the language definition (as
I understand it.

xt-cle.cray-xt-cray.none.fifo.pthreads
--------------------------------------
The following compiler segfaults(?) appeared only once on 9/28/12
[Error matching compiler output for release/examples/primers/opaque]
