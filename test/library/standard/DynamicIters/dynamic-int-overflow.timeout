# This test can't produce any output in the loop body, because the
# loop body is executed 2**63 times.  With an empty loop body and
# --fast, the test completes in a second.  But when the test fails,
# there may be some large constant factor of extra loop iterations.
# Given enough time, this may complete, and still produce no output,
# and so still match the .good file.
#
# If this test fails due to execution timeout, try running with
# -sdebugDynamicIters=true
#
# Set a 7 second timeout so that if the overflow problem recurs, this
# test will fail.  I'd make it 2 seconds, but it takes over 25 seconds to
# compile on my machine, and compilation is limited to 4*timeout
