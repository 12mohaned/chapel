bug: Cannot Access module-scope function from shadowed record-scope method

Due to scoping rules in Chapel, the only way to access a function or variable
that shares the same name as a method or field is to specify the scope with
the module accessor. This future demonstrates that this does not work for
methods shadowing functions.

Confusingly, the error emitted is:

    use of 'A' before encountering its definition, type unknown

, despite the A module being accessible elsewhere within the method.
