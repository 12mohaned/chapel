semantic: parent module uses

Should a parent module's 'use' be inherited by a child module that
'use's the parent?  This series of accessPrivateUsedSibling2*.chpl
tests shows that we're inconsistent in this regard.

No: Why should what the parent re-exports be different for the child
    than for anything else?

    As a parent, maybe I want access to something in one of my
    children that I don't necessarily want all my other children to
    get automatically?  And they can always use/import the sibling
    directly if need be.

Yes: Children have special relationships with their parents and
     siblings
