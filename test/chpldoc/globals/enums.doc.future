bug: documentation of globals with default value that is an enum is ugly

When a global indicates that its default value is an enum, at the moment we
document it as `.(<enum>, <value>)` instead of <enum>.<value>.  This incorrect
behavior displays part of our compiler internals and should be fixed.

For example:

var foo = Color.Red;

gets displayed as:

var foo = .(Color, "Red")

It is probably related to a similar problem with fields (see
test/chpldoc/types/fields/enums.doc.chpl)
