bug: documentation of fields with default value that is an enum is ugly

When a field indicates that its default value is an enum, at the moment we
document it as `.(<enum>, <value>)` instead of <enum>.<value>.  This incorrect
behavior displays part of our compiler internals and should be fixed.

It is probably related to a similar problem with globals (see
test/chpldoc/globals/enums.doc.chpl)
