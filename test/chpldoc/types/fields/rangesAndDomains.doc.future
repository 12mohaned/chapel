bug: chpldoc generates function calls for some range and domain literals

chpldoc emits the function names for some of the range builders and for
chpl__buildDomainExpr instead of cleaning them up to look like the original
literals.

For example:

```chapel
1..10 => 1..10

1.. => BoundedRangeType.boundedLowchpl_build_partially_bounded_range1

{1..10} => chpl__buildDomainExpr(1..10)
```
