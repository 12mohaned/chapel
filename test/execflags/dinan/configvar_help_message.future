feature request: comments following config vars to appear in --help message

This is a feature suggestion we discussed where a comment that is associated
with a config var could be displayed in the --help message.  For example if a
chapel program we might have:

config const k: int; // Order of Legendre Polynomial basis

Which would result in a help message (eg './a.out --help') containing:

  k: int          -- Order of Legendre Polynomial basis
