associative-of-strings fails on non-zero locales

This test gets either an OOB error or a segfault when running on 2+
locales.  I believe that the issue relates to using string keys that
are allocated on locale 0 and then used w.r.t. an associative array on
locale 1.  Specifically, changing from string keys/values to integers
makes the error go away, as does storing the `keys` array on the same
locale as the associtaive domain, as does changing the intents on the
default associative's dsiAccess() routines to 'const in'.  That said,
I'm still not quite sure where the blame lies here.
