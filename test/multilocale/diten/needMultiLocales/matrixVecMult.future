bug: Distributed array of arrays fails to compile when compiling generated code

This code should create a 1D block distributed array of arrays for use in
the parallel matrix vector multiply. The generated C code has type errors.

Changing the uses of DistColumnDom to just ColumnDom allows the code to compile
and run.
