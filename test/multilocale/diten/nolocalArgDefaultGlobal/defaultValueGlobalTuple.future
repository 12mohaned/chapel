bug: Using a global as a function argument's default value

Default values that access globals and whose access looks like a function call
cause a seg fault in function resolution in --no-local compilations. When
a call to _heapAccess inserted in normalize is being flattened into a temp,
there is a problem because formals aren't full statements.
