performance: remote value forwarding disabled for array descriptors

Privatized array descriptors should be able to be remote value
forwarded by the Chapel compiler, even in the presence of sync vars
since the descriptor's identity is const even if the array is not.

I have a patch that's currently being tested that will enable this
and also fix last night's RA regressions due to the new sync var
guarded verification loop.
