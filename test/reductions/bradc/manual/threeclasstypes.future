unimplemented feature: constructing generic classes

Switched syntaxes to something that Steve thinks makes more sense for
default type bindings.  This isn't expected to work yet.

This implementation tries to create three type variables
within a class (to meet an external interface, e.g.) which
doesn't seem to work as I've written it.  I think there's
a question here as to whether I've written something legal,
and if not, how I ought to write it.
