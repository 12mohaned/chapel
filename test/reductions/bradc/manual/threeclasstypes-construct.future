error message: type assignment in constructors

The question here was whether to allow assignment of types within a
user-supplied constructor.  The answer was "no", but that a similar
effect could be achieved using type parameters to the constructors
with default values.  Not quite as nice, but maybe a step in the right
direction.  This test needs a better error message (the current one
isn't clear and says nothing about the line in question and).  I'm
adding a second test for the other variation.

Brad: I continue to think that type assignment within constructors
is a reasonable way to bind formal types to a class' generic types
(with the understanding that they have to be at the top level, will
be evaluated at compile-time, etc.)
