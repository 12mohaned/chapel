constructors/error messages

The question here was whether to allow assignment of types within a
user-supplied constructor.  The answer was "no", but that a similar
effect could be achieved using type parameters to the constructors
with default values.  Not quite as nice, but maybe a step in the right
direction.  This test needs a better error message (the current one
isn't clear and says nothing about the line in question and).  I'm
adding a second test for the other variation.

We don't currently support constructors and this does a slightly weird
thing anyway by passing a type to a constructor and doing bindings
to type variables within the constructor.

not all type variables are defined in the constructor call

???

This tries to call a user-supplied default constructor that
takes a type parameter, which doesn't seem to be implemented
yet.  This relates somewhat to the email conversation we
were having at and after last week's meeting (June 2nd).
