type variable in class referred to in non-generic function fails

???

Here's another good one for discussion.  This one is not
expected to work yet because we don't yet implement arrays
as classes.  But assuming we did, it seems like it would
be nice to be able to refer to its element type and use
that to instantiate another class.  Is this legal?
