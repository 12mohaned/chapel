bug: not all reduction classes are deleted

To prevent arrays returned for reductions from being deleted, I commented out
the line in the compiler that inserts the delete call to clean up reduction
classes. Once it is safe to call the array destructor from the reduction
destructor, that line should be uncommented and this test should start passing.
