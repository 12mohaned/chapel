arrays

This test attempts to compute the index of the maximum value of a
matrix A.  When A is passed to the maxIndex function, it compiles.
When abs(A) is passed as the argument to the maxIndex function, it
does not compile, giving this error:

test_arrayops.chpl:10: error: unresolved call 'maxIndex(:_ic_abs)'
test_arrayops.chpl:12: note: candidates are: maxIndex(A: _array)

Shouldn't abs(A) be an array as well?
