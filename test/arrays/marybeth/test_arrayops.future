error message: iterator sugaring

This test doesn't work under our current semantics due to the
fact that array arguments are passed by reference and we don't
insert array temps, so abs(A) doesn't have an l-value/can't
be passed by reference.

Brad's preferred way to fix this would be to support a "const"
intent and allow r-value array values to be passed into functions
that have read-only arguments.

In any case, this error message could be improved for the time
being to sugar the _ic_abs message.


Original:

This test attempts to compute the index of the maximum value of a
matrix A.  When A is passed to the maxIndex function, it compiles.
When abs(A) is passed as the argument to the maxIndex function, it
does not compile, giving this error:

test_arrayops.chpl:10: error: unresolved call 'maxIndex(:_ic_abs)'
test_arrayops.chpl:12: note: candidates are: maxIndex(A: _array)

Shouldn't abs(A) be an array as well?
