bug: array slicing

It appears that when slicing into an array via a singleton
index, the current implementation doesn't zipper the array
assignments properly, but propagates the last value in
the source slice across all values in the destination slice.
Note that while this test uses the syntax that we've talked
about using for rank-changing slicing, the test itself
should be independent of whether or not we adopt that
interpretation.
