bug: array slicing with unbounded dimensions should be bounds-checked

My sense is that unbounded dimensions that are completely
out-of-bounds for an array should probably result in an
out-of-bounds message.  If the implementation suggests
otherwise, though, I'm not strongly opposed to the current
implementation which results in an empty array.  I think
the main downside to this interpretation is that if a
user accidentally slices out-of-bounds, it's hard for
them to detect that fact.
