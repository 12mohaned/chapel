???: unresolved range constructor call in ChapelRange.chpl

The compiler is complaining about an unresolved range constructor
call in this code.  I wasn't able to find the problem the last
time I looked at it, but have not had a chance to return to it
for a second look.  Checking in, in hopes that cooler minds might
be able to see the issue.

This is part of my general attempt to support more general
interactions between ranges and indexing of various integer
types (e.g., to allow a 32-bit integer or range to index into
or slice something declared using a 64-bit integer or range).
