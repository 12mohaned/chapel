bug: array assignment/initialization semantics broken in some cases

This future shows that we are no longer copying arrays as we should be
in certain cases.  In particular, the assignments from A[1] to B and
from B to C should result in deep 3-element copies, yet somehow we are
ending up with a nil pointer in B.

This seems to have started occurring as of r21300 when donor functions
were introduced.  It seems likely that an array is being donated when
it should not be, yet I also don't have intuition for why this would
occur (since donor functions seem to be applied only to autocopies,
and autocopies are not invoked during initialization, to my
knowledge).

It's also worth noting that the array-of-arrays plays some role here.
If A is simply a flat array (and the A[1]s are changed into As], the
program works as expected.
