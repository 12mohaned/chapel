bug: r22257 causes coerce/promote wrapper problem.

As a result of r22257, the --no-inline we throw here causes the problem
described by test/functions/sungeun/promotionWithNoInline.future.  So
for now, we're making this test a future also.  For now we're also
adding a skipif so that this is not run for CHPL_COMM==none, in which
configuration it passes.

When this .future file is removed, the .skipif should be removed also!
