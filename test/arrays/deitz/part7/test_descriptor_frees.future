bug: compiler leaking iterator classes due to 'followThis' arguments

[This should've gone in with the commit I just made, but I forgot
about it until I was well into the log message]

Prior to the commit I just made reducing formal temps, this test
worked.  Removing formal temps for 'followThis' arguments causes
iterator classes to be leaked that weren't before, bumping up the
amount of memory leaked by this test.  I put a hack into
functionResolution.cpp that adds temps for followThis arguments and
closes this leak, but Tom and I decided not to enable the hack and to
future-ize this test instead for the time being.  This leak seems
specific to zippered forall loops, but I was unable to determine how
the presence or absence of formal temps for 'followThis' arguments
would cause or fix a leak.
