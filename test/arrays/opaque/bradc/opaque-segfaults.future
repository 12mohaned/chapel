bug: opaque domains/arrays can lead to seg fault

This test attempts to build a random graph, and in doing
so gets a seg fault.  The problem may lie in the associative
domain/array code -- there is some indication that a
reallocated array is not having its values initialized to
the element's default value; though it could be some other
problem masquerading as that.
