bug: opaque domains/arrays can lead to seg fault

This test attempts to build a random graph, and in doing
so gets a seg fault.  The problem may lie in the associative
domain/array code -- there is some indication that a
reallocated array is not having its values initialized to
the element's default value; though it could be some other
problem masquerading as that.

03/2008: Rewrote the associative domain/array code, but
haven't had a chance to re-test this because it relies
on arrays of arrays within classes (due to the opaque
array of arithmetic arrays -- opaque arrays are implemented
with associative, which use arithmetic arrays of the element
type).
