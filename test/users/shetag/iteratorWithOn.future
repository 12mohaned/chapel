unimplemented feature: yield in on statement

This should be legal.

error message: internal failure SYM0595 chpl Version 0.6.-999

This test has an iterator that yields values in the sequence 0..n on a cyclic
ordering of locales. The output in .good file was obtained by moving the on
clause to the loop driven by the iterator. This change is captured as another
test iteratorWithoutOn.chpl and expectedly the two have matching outputs from
running with -nl 5.
