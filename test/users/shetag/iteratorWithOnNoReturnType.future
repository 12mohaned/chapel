bug: yield type inference errors for iterator containing on

The iteratorWithOn.chpl test shows the case where the return type is
specified, which gives the error about yielding within an 'on' as
expected. But this test fails earlier than that because the yield
statement within the 'on' is not traversed when inferring the yield type
for the iterator.
