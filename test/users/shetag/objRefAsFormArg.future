object reference as formal argument in user constructor

error: internal failure MIS0208 chpl Version 0.7.-999

The class B in this test has member "a" reference to class A object.
The formal argument used to initialize member "a" in class B's user
constructor has to be explicitly typed i.e. def B(a:A = nil). Removing
the type i.e. def B(a = nil) causes the compilation to fail.
