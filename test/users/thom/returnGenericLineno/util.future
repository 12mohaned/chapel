bug: line number misreported

The second line number in this test's error message:

strassen.chpl:12: In function 'getInstance':
strassen.chpl:45: error: unresolved type specifier 'Strassen()'
strassen.chpl:18: note: candidates are: Strassen(type n)

Does not exist in the given file, and seems to be based on the
location of the function arrayEquals() in util.chpl (move it
around to see this).

Also, rearranging the order of the files specified on the
command line seems to change the problems reported.
