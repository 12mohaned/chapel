semantic: able to return generic classes?

This future asks the question whether or not it should be legal to
return an uninstantiated generic class.  

Arguments for: we permit a similar thing to be done for formal
arguments and it's convenient.  

Arguments against: in the presence of multiple returns, it may be
difficult/impossible to determine the type of the generic (though
perhaps we could only report an error in that case?)
