bug: small int/uint literals not codegenerated properly

This test shows that we don't code generate small int/uint literals
properly.  We generated undecorated literals, like "1" which default
to the C int size, which may be smaller/different than the Chapel type
for the literal.  In this case, the user requested that the literal be
a uint(64), but for most C compilers, it ends up being a 32-bit int.

I'm currently testing a fix for this.
