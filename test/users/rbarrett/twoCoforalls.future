bug: multiple coforalls generate conflicting symbol names

It appears that when two coforall loops are used within the same
symbol scope, the compiler generates a duplicate symbol with the
same name:

twoCoforalls.chpl:22: error: '_ss' has multiple definitions, redefined at:
  twoCoforalls.chpl:31 [semanticChecks.cpp:31]
