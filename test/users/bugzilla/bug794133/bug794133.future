bug: reference counting (domains in) arrays of arrays

This bug exhibits an issue in which for an array:

  var A: [D] [1..2] real;

we reference count the anonymous {1..2} domain once for each
index in D.  If D is empty, it is never reference counted
and may be deallocated prematurely if it leaves scope before
the end of A's lifetime.  As a result the proposed fix
(underway) is to reference count the domain based on the
lifetime of A/A's type rather than (or in addition to)
the number of elements in A.
