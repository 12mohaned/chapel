bug: the statement 'type T = myfun(...).type;' evaluates myfun at run time.

In this case, it is the statement:

      type followT = myden(myDims, whole.dims()).type;

where

    proc myden(a,b) {
      writeln("in myden");
      ....
    }

Currently I get "in myden" printouts when running the program.
However, the .type expression should only resolve its argument,
but not codegen it.

This resulted from my work on 1-d BlockCyclic. I have not tried
to trim down the test case.
