bug: crashes with "*** glibc detected *** a.out: double free or corruption (fasttop): 0x000000000064d050 ***"

... with comm=none. This happens when this piece of generated code:

    T35 = (T16.vlock_DOLLAR_);
    _CHECK_NIL(T35, 1809, "/users/vass/inf/sdir/chapel/modules/internal/ChapelArray.chpl");
    chpl___TILDA__syncvar4(T35);
    chpl_free((void*)T35, 1809, "/users/vass/inf/sdir/chapel/modules/internal/ChapelArray.chpl"); T35 = NULL;

occurs 3 times in a row (replacing T35 with T36 and T37 in the 2nd and
3rd copies, respectively).

ChapelArray.chpl:1809  is the line with the 'for' below (in of chpl__initCopy)
(yes, the commented out lines were actually commented out in my version):

  for e in irc {
    //pragma "no copy" /*pragma "insert auto destroy"*/ var ee = e;
    if i > size {
      size = size * 2;
      D = [1..size];
    }
    //A(i) = ee;
    A(i) = e;
    i = i + 1;
  }
