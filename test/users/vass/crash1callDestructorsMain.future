bug: compiler crashes with assertion error [callDestructors.cpp:256]

NOTE: It is currently skipif'ed for --no-local/etc.
Once this test works for --local, enable it for --no-local and re-test.

The current failure mode under --no-local --devel is:
$CHPL_HOME/modules/internal/ChapelDistribution.chpl:114: In function 'destroyDom':
$CHPL_HOME/modules/internal/ChapelDistribution.chpl:123: error: SymExpr::var::defPoint is not in AST [expr.cpp:263]


I did not investigate, but seems like it is due to having the same
declaration(s) in the current file *and* in a 'use'-ed module
(see 'use crash1callDestructorsAddon' in the middle of the .chpl file
- the contents of that module duplicate the first half of the .chpl file).
