bug: gcc compiler complains "error: will never be executed"

(This is in the "cc1: warnings being treated as errors" mode, on lnx-vass.)

The following code has some param conditionals without the 'else':

  if stride > 0 {
      if hasLowBound() then return checkAl(low);
  //  else                  return checkAmb();
  } else {
      if hasHighBound() then return checkAl(high);
  //  else                   return checkAmb();
  }
  return checkAmb();

If the two lines are uncommented, C compilation goes smoothly.

Probably some expected optimization is not firing - or that's just
my particular setup. Let's see how it comes out from the nightly testing.
