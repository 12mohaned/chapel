error message: in the developer mode, error messages for internal failures
need to indicate that those are internal failures.

Right now I get "internal failure CAL0035" in the user mode but the following
in the developer mode:
  internal-error-message.chpl:90: error: actual type is unknown or generic [callInfo.cpp:35]

This is misleading because the developer mode message looks like
it arises from a bug in the user code.  Should be "error: internal failure"
in both user and developer modes.
