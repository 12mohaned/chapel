bug: assignment of unbounded range to bounded not disallowed

This test shows that it's legal to assign an unbounded range value to
a bounded range type without the compiler complaining.  Or, if this
should be legal with the boundedness inferred, then the range doesn't
seem to be getting stored as an unbounded range (though I don't think
this is the case).
