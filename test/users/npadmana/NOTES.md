TODO
----

1. Fix segfault.
1. thread support
1. MPI support
1. Pull C prototypes out to allow power users to access things directly (maybe??)

NOTES
-----

1. This is a pretty low-level interface. One can imagine higher level wrappers to do things
more directly for users who don't want to deal with reading the FFTW manual.
1. The testFFTW.chpl routine is a good example of how to use these routines.
