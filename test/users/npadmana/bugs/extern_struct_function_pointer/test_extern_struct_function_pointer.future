Trying to parse (in an extern block) a C structure with a function pointer as a member
triggers an internal compiler error. It isn't surprising that this 
doesn't work, since Chapel doesn't have a defined way to pass function 
pointers back to C.

It would be nice if this just treated the structure as an opaque type.

I'll note that this is the only issue I've run into getting 
Chapel to parse the GSL header files - which is quite impressive.

The way around this right now is to make a dummy declaration/header file,
which is how I've handled the GSL cases. But getting this working would 
mean that the GSL headers could be parsed as-is, and the GSL functions
would be useable in Chapel with no work.
