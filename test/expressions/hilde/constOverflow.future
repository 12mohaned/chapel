feature request: Protect user from integer overflow oddities.

Chapel should have well-specified behavior w.r.t. integer overflow, so that this
can be implemented consistently across all platforms.  Some options are:
 - Always roll over silently
     max(int(64)) + 1 == min(int(64))
     max(uint(64)) + 1 == min(uint(64)), etc.
 - Throw an integer overflow exception (very future).
