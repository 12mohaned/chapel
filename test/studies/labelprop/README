Label Propagation for Community Detection

see CUGâ€™15 paper: Implementing a social-network analytics pipeline using
Spark on Urika XA

Computation consists of these steps:
* Read in gzip files storing JSON-encoded tweets
* Find pairs of Twitter users that @mention each other
* Construct a graph from such users
* Run a label propagation algorithm on that graph
* Output the community structure resulting from label propagation
