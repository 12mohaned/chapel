error messages

This version of the code generates an error message that 
points to a function header.  It seems that the error
relates to the type mismatch in the conditional expression
on line 42.  I've created a .good file for that error, if
that is in fact an error (in particular, should the int
literal implicitly be coereced to match the uint branch?
If so, then maybe this isn't an error at all...)
