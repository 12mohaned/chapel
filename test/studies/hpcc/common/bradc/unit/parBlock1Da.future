unimplemented feature: leader/follower iterators on domain/array wrappers

This future captures why stream-block1d.chpl isn't working --
leader/follower iterators that are defined on a set of distribution
classes do not seem to be propagated to the domain/array wrapper
records.  Haven't looked into how hard this would be to do yet, am
just capturing the case.
