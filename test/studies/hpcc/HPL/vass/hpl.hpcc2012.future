???: hpcc2012 version of HPL is race-y when rewritten to avoid '=>'

In rewriting this version of HPL to avoid the use of the (deprecated)
'=>' operator and use reindexing instead, a race seems to have been
introduced in which a few different failing behaviors occur, such as
failing verification, having bogus indices being computed on in the
reindex array view, etc.  It's unclear whether the cause of the race
is in the benchmark itself, the Dimensional distribution, or the
reindex array view.  A bug in the latter two would be problematic, but
neither has had much weight put on them yet, so it's not clear where
the source is.  We haven't had a chance to dig into this to determine
the source and don't currently consider this as high-priority as other
issues, so are futurizing the test for now.
