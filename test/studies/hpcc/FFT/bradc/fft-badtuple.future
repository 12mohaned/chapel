When I wrote the first forall expression in this
test, I intended to cast i to float and then
multiply it by 2.  It seems to be being interpreted
as a homogeneous tuple cast, which seems unfortunate,
and the error message that this generates is difficult
to understand.  Would either like to have this work
as intended or generate a better error message (in the
latter case, this seems like yet another case that might
cause us to re-think our homogeneous tuple specification
-- note that if it required parenthesis, this ambiguity
would not have occurred).
