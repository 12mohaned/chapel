advanced array passing

This is a very advanced version of the twiddles function in
which we use an anonymous domain with an unspecified bound to
refer to an array's size rather than a separate query function.  
Though I  think there are questions about how far we'd want to 
push this concept, I think for the simple 1D case it can make
sense.  Not sure where I'd draw the line currently...
