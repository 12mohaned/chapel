This test does not pass when running in a linux64 environment.  The
error doesn't match in the second most significant digit.

This problem is most likely due to using different libraries in the
linux64 environment and build than in the linux one.  When the error
is computed, the answers themselves differ in the 16th digit, which is
about as much precision as you can expect.

Before dismissing the problem, though, I'd like to keep this as a future
until a more thorough comparison of the linux and linux64 environments are
done.
