MODIFICATIONS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL hpcc-1.2.0

src/io.c:

Make it possible to specify at runtime the benchmarks to be run.
Specify 2 additional lines in hpccinf.txt (if EOF is hit, ignore).

The 4 additional lines are as follows:

(1) ignored line (will fill with benchmark order for reference)

## PTRANS|HPL|*DGEMM|sDGEMM|*Stream|sStream|MPIRA|*RA|sRA|MPIFFT|*FFT|sFFT|LB ##

(2) an unsigned integer which is used as a bit mask to turn the
    various benchmarks on/off (based on order above).  For example,
    384==110000000 which means run StarStream and Single Stream.

(3) Log of the MPIRandomAccess problem size

(4) Log of the MPIRandomAccess number of updates


The only additional overhead added is that these settings must be
broadcast to all processors.  To avoid changing the params data
structure, I just always have it broadcast all the values.  If this
turns out to take too much time, I can changed it to be smarter (only
broadcast if necessary, broadcast a single message, etc.)


RandomAccess/RandomAccess.h:

Surround #define MAX_TOTAL_PENDING_UPDATE with an #ifndef to make it
possible to change this value via a compile-time flag.


RandomAccess/MPIRandomAccess.c:

Small change to use (3) & (4) above if defined in the input file.
