How could I create an array of domains, or something to that effect,
that would let me create a domain "lower_ghost_cells" that would handle
all dimensions?

I can make a tuple of domains...

Are there plans to enforce subdomains more strictly than at present?
In particular, is assigning physical_cells before all_cells kosher?



Looks like the dimension would need to be a compile-time constant.  This
is reasonable, yes?  But then I'd need expressions like
    var blah: dim*domain(dim);
to work, which they currently don't appear to.


Need a way to take tensor products of domains.


p.112 of spec: stridable or strided?


Error using -=1 on a single component of a tuple.
