Source changes
--------------
* drop main()?

* why doesn't the complex math look like complex math?  What can I
  learn from Jacob's?

* we should have the modules automatically strength reduce divisions
  by powers of two

* what would it take to do a good row-at-a-time implementation?
  - task private 'in' array variables
  - search to right place in the file

* why can't we open the writer using stdin.writer()?

* why don't writeln()s to the writer work as hoped?


Performance improvements
------------------------
* make writes on contiguous RMO arrays blast it out with one write
  rather than element-by-element
