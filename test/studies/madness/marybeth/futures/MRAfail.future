bug: generic argument loses type in recursive calls (?)

(Sorry for the length of this test.  I wasn't able to recreate this
problem outside of Madness.  I tried to condense the code to include
only what was necessary, but it's still long.  I also don't know what
to name the bug.)

Starting on line 484 of MRAfail is the diff method for the Function
class.  The diff method contains diffHelper, which has a tuple argument,
curNode and a generic argument, result.  Diffhelper is called recursively
and when it is, the type of the result argument seems to be lost.  

Changing lines 492-493 and lines 510-511 from:

diffHelper(child(1), result);
diffHelper(child(2), result);

to:

diffHelper((n+1, 2*l), result);
diffHelper((n+1, 2*l+1), result);

then makes the test work.
