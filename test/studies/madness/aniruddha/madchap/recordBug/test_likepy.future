bug: nil dereference/valgrind error in record w/ associative domain/array fields

This is a copy of Aniruddha's madness code from the previous directory
that demonstrates that a record copy of an associative array field
whose elements are records with arithmetic arrays in the context of
an iterator causes a bad memory reference when running under valgrind;
a nil pointer dereference when running without.

After being unable to whittle this down to a smaller case, am guessing
that it's likely to be a bug in the associative domain/array code related
to buildEmptyDomain and/or getIndices/setIndices, but am not yet sure.
Am planning to use this as an excuse to rewrite associative domains/arrays
to not use _ddata fields...
