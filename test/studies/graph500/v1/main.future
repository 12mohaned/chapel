bug: under GASNet: *** Caught a fatal signal: SIGSEGV(11) on node XX/YY

NO crashes have been observed with comm=none, as of this writing.

The GASNet crash is INTERMITTENT.
I often get it when running the program right after compilation.

For the record, when running with GASNET_BACKTRACE=1,
the thread that catches SIGSEGV has the following at the bottom of the stack:
