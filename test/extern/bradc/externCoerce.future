bug: extern functions don't get coercion wrappers

It seems that extern functions don't get coercion wrappers built
for them, which causes an "unknown return type" style message
when they are called with arguments that require coercions.
This test demonstrates that.  This makes externs a bit fragile
in general.  For example, sqrt(4) wouldn't work if sqrt was
declared as an extern (and if there was no real(32) version that
caught the integer first?) because the coercion would be needed.
