bug: pruning of empty records and externs

This bug demonstrates that _extern declarations of empty extern
records get pruned out of the compiler AST, like other empty records.
This should not happen because we permit the user to specify partial
information about an external record, and therefore an empty external
record is a reasonable thing.  Moreover, we shouldn't ever remove
arguments from external functions.
