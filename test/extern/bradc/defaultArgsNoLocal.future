feature request: extern functions w/ default args and return values

For some reason, this works with --local, but not with --no-local.
My guess is that it is related to the same wrapper problem as
defaultArgsUseReturn.future and that fixing that will fix this,
but I wanted to file it just in case that wasn't the case.
