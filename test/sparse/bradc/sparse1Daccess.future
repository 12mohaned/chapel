bug: sparse 1D access in presence of multidimensional domain

For some reason, accessing a sparse 1D array when the code contains
domains of other dimensions causes the member() functions to resolve
as I would expect.  Note that removing D3 from this code causes things
to work.

Related, note that adding a where clause to the member() function for
the 1D sparse case causes the compiler to seg fault.
