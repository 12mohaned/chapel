Feature request: allow an index variable in a loop over a non-'var' iterator to be mutable.

For example, using a 'var' keyword in the loop header.
Assuming myIter() is a non-var iterator:

  for     myVar in myIter() do myVar += 1; // error: myVar is 'const'

  for var myVar in myIter() do myVar += 1; // OK!

The following tests were assuming that the index variable is mutable,
and at present contain a workaround, which is an explicit variable
declaration assigned from an index variable first thing in the loop:

  test/regexp/ferguson/rechan.chpl
  test/release/examples/benchmarks/miniMD/explicit/helpers/forces.chpl
  test/release/examples/benchmarks/miniMD/helpers/forces.chpl
  test/studies/glob/Glob.chpl
