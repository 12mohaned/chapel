Chapel is an imperative programming language.  The basic concepts of the
language should be familiar to users of C, Fortran, Java, Modula and Ada.
However, the syntax of the Chapel language does not directly build upon any of 
these existing languages.   Programmers should start afresh when programming in 
Chapel and not be limited to the constructs of existing languages.
