Chapel pushes the state-of-the-art in parallel programming
by focusing on productivity and not just performance. In particular
Chapel combines the goal of highest possible
object code performance with that of programmability
by supporting a high level interface resulting in
shorter time-to-solution and reduced application development
cost. The design of Chapel is guided by four key
areas of programming language technology: global-view programming,
locality-awareness, object-orientation, and generic
programming.
