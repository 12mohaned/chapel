\subsection{Function Definitions}
\label{Function_Definitions}

Functions, iterators, and methods (collectively referred to as
functions in places) are declared with the following syntax:
\begin{syntax}
function-declaration-statement:
  `def' type-binding[OPT] function-name argument-list[OPT]
    return-type[OPT] where-clause[OPT] block-level-statement

type-binding:
  identifier .

function-name:
  identifier
  = identifier
  operator-name

operator-name: one of
  + - * / % ** && || ! == <= >= < > << >> & | ^ ~ #

argument-list:
  ( formals[OPT] )

formals:
  formal
  formal , formals

formal:
  formal-tag identifier formal-type[OPT] default-expression[OPT]
  formal-tag identifier formal-type[OPT] variable-argument-expression

formal-type:
  : type
  : TQUESTION identifier

default-expression:
  = expression

variable-argument-expression:
  ... expression
  ... TQUESTION identifier

formal-tag: one of
  in out inout param type
\end{syntax}
Iterators are discussed in Section~\ref{Iterators}.  Methods are
discussed in Section~\ref{Class_Methods}.

\subsection{The Return Statement}
\label{The_Return_Statement}

The return statement must appear in a function.  It exits that
function, returning control to the point at which that function was
called.  It can optionally return a value.  The syntax of the return
statement is given by
\begin{syntax}
return-statement:
  `return' expression[OPT] ;
\end{syntax}
