Like the integral types, the real types can be parameterized by the
number of bits used to represent them.  The default real
type, \chpl{real}, is 64 bits.  The real types that are supported are
machine-dependent, but usually include \chpl{real(32)}
and \chpl{real(64)}, and sometimes include \chpl{real(128)}.

Arithmetic over real values follows the IEEE 754 standard.
