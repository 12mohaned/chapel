Chapel defines a logical data type designated by the symbol
\chpl{bool} with the two predefined values \chpl{true} and
\chpl{false}.

The relational operators return values of \chpl{bool} type and the
logical operators operate on values of \chpl{bool} type.

Some statements require expressions of \chpl{bool} type and Chapel
supports a special conversion of values to \chpl{bool} type when used
in this context (Section~\ref{Implicit_Statement_Bool_Conversions}).
For example, an integer can be used as the condition in a conditional
statement.  It is converted to \chpl{false} if it is zero, and
otherwise, it is converted to \chpl{true}.
