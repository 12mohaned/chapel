Like the integral types, the floating-point types can be parameterized
by the number of bits used to represent them.  The floating-point
types that are supported are machine-dependent, but usually include
\chpl{float(32)} and \chpl{float(64)}, and sometimes include
\chpl{float(128)}.

Arithmetic over floating-point values follows the IEEE 754 standard.
