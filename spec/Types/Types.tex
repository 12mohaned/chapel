Chapel is a statically typed language with a rich set of types.  These
include a set of predefined primitive types, enumerated types,
classes, records, unions, tuples, sequences, domains, and arrays.
This section defines the primitive types, enumerated types, and type
aliases.

Programmers can define their own enumerated types, classes, records,
unions, and type aliases in type declaration statements summarized by
the following syntax:
\begin{syntax}
type-declaration-statement:
  enum-declaration-statement
  class-declaration-statement
  record-declaration-statement
  union-declaration-statement
  type-alias-declaration-statement
\end{syntax}

Classes are discussed in Section~\ref{Classes}.  Records are discussed
in Section~\ref{Records}.  Unions are discussed in
Section~\ref{Unions}.  Tuples are discussed in Section~\ref{Tuples}.
Sequences are discussed in Section~\ref{Sequences}.  Domains and
arrays are discussed in Section~\ref{Domains_and_Arrays}.
