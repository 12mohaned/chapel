Enumerated types are declared with the following syntax:
\begin{syntax}
enum-declaration-statement:
  `enum' identifier { enum-constant-list } ;

enum-constant-list
  enum-constant
  enum-constant , enum-constant-list

enum-constant:
  identifier init-part[OPT]

init-part:
  = expression
\end{syntax}

An enumerated type defines a set of named constants.  These are
associated with parameters of integral type.  Each enumerated type is
a distinct type.
