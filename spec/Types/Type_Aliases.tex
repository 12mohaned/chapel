Type aliases are declared with the following syntax:
\begin{syntax}
type-alias-declaration-statement:
  `type' identifier type-part[OPT] ;

type-part:
  = type ;
\end{syntax}
A type alias is a symbol that aliases any type as specified in the
\sntx{type-part}.  A use of a type alias has the same meaning as using
the type specified by \sntx{type-part} directly.

The \sntx{type-part} is optional in the definition of a class, record,
or union.  Its absence makes the class, record, or union
generic \rsec{Generics}.
