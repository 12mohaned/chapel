\subsubsection{The file type}

\subsubsection{Standard files {\em stdout}, {\em stdin}, and {\em stderr}}

\subsubsection{The {\em fwrite} function}

\subsubsection{The {\em fread} function}

\subsubsection{The {\em write}, {\em writeln}, and {\em read} functions}

\subsubsection{Default {\em fread} and {\em fwrite} functions}

Default {\em fwrite} functions are created for all types for which a
user {\em fwrite} function is not defined.  They have the following
semantics:
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\bf sequences} Outputs the elements of the sequence in order
delimited by the sequence delimiters \chpl{(/} and \chpl{/)} and
separated by commas.
\item
{\bf arrays} Outputs the elements of the array in row-major order
where rows are separated by line-feeds and blank lines are used to
separate other dimensions.
\item
{\bf classes} Outputs the values within the fields of the class
prefixed by the name of the field and the character \chpl{=}.  Each
field is separated by a comma.  The output is delimited by \chpl{\{}
and \chpl{\}}.
\item
{\bf records} Outputs the values within the fields of the class
prefixed by the name of the field and the character \chpl{=}.  Each
field is separated by a comma.  The output is delimited by \chpl{(}
and \chpl{)}.
\end{itemize}

Default {\em fread} functions are created for all types for which a
user {\em fread} function is not defined.  The semantics of the
default {\em fread} functions are forthcoming.
