Synchronized variables support a number of special methods. These
include the following on synchronized variable s
\begin{chapel}
purge(s)      // force s to be empty
writeFE(s, v) // wait for full, assign s=v, and leave empty
writeXF(s, v) // no wait, assign s=v, and leave full
writeXE(s, v) // no wait, assign s=v, and leave empty
readFF(s)     // wait full, leave full, and return s's value
readXF(s)     // no wait, leave full, and return s's value
readXX(s)     // no wait, leave F/E unchanged, and return s's value
\end{chapel}
