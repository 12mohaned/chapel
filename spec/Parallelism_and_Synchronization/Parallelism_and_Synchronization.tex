Chapel is an explicitly parallel programming language. Parallelism is
introduced into a program by the user with three constructs,
\chpl{forall}, \chpl{begin}, and \chpl{cobegin}.  Synchronization is
provided with \emph{synchronizing variables} and atomic statements. To
avoid any unintended implications, we use the terms \emph{computation}
and \emph{sub-computation} to refer to distinct, concurrently
executing portions of the program.
