Chapel is an explicitly parallel programming language. Parallelism is
introduced into a program by the user with three constructs,
\chpl{forall}, \chpl{begin}, and \chpl{cobegin}.  Synchronization is
provided with synchronized variables and atomic transactions. To avoid
any unintended implications, we use the terms ``computation'' and
``sub-computation'' to refer to distinct, concurrently executing
portions of the program.
