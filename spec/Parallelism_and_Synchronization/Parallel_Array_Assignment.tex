Array assignments are done in parallel. Each array element is assigned
in parallel. If there are duplicate values in the sequence, then the
order of the element-wise assignments is arbitrary.

\begin{example}
\begin{chapel}
X(S) = Y;
\end{chapel}
X is an array and S a sequence of index values. The execution of all X(S$_i$)=Y
occurs concurrently.
\end{example}
