The semantics of array assignments is that each array element is
assigned in parallel. If there are duplicate values in the sequence,
then the order of the element-wise assignments is arbitrary.

\begin{example}
\begin{chapel}
X(S) = Y;
\end{chapel}
X is an array and S a sequence of index values. The execution of all X(S$_i$)=Y
occurs concurrently. The compiler and runtime will decide how many computations
are used to execute the array assignment.
\end{example}
