The cobegin statement spawns a computation for each of the statements
in the block-statement that it immediately precedes.  When each of
these computations finish, control continues with the next statement.
The syntax for the cobegin statement is given by
\begin{syntax}
cobegin-statement:
  `cobegin' block-statement
\end{syntax}

The second form of creating parallelism is with the \chpl{cobegin}
statement. The \chpl{cobegin} statement syntax is
\begin{syntax}
cobegin-statement:
  `cobegin' block-statement
\end{syntax}
Each statement in the \chpl{block-statement} is executed concurrently
and is considered a separate computation. Control continues after all
of the statements within the \chpl{block-statement} have been
evaluated. As with \chpl{forall}, control transfers are not permitted
either into or out of the body of a \chpl{cobegin} statement. As
with \chpl{forall}, \chpl{yield} statements are allowed.

Variables declared in the \chpl{cobegin} compound statment are {\em single
assignment variables} \ref{Single_Assignment_Variables}.
