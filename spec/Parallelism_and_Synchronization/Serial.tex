The serial statement is used to control the parallelism encountered
dynamically in the execution.  The syntax for the serial statement is
given by
\begin{syntax}
serial-statement:
  `serial' expression block-level-statement
\end{syntax}

The \chpl{serial} statement is used to control the parallelism.
The syntax of \chpl{serial} is
\begin{chapel}
serial <expr> <block> ;
\end{chapel}
where \chpl{<expr>} evaluates to a \chpl{bool}.  Regardless of that
value, \chpl{<block>} is evaluated. If the value evaluates to
\chpl{true} however, any dynamically encountered \chpl{forall} or
\chpl{cobegin} statement is executed sequentially.
