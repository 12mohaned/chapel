The \chpl{serial} statement can be used to control the degree of parallelism.
The serial statement is used to control the parallelism encountered
dynamically in the execution.  The syntax for the serial statement is
given by
\begin{syntax}
serial-statement:
  `serial' expression block-level-statement
\end{syntax}
where \chpl{exprression} evaluates to a \chpl{bool}.  Regardless of
that value, \chpl{block-level-statement} is evaluated. If
the \chpl{expression} evaluates to \chpl{true}, any dynamically
encountered \chpl{forall} or \chpl{cobegin} statement is executed
sequentially within that computation.
