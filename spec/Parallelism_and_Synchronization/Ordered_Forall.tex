The keyword \chpl{ordered} has no effect if \chpl{<expr>} is a
sequence value but affects order of evaluation when \chpl{<expr>} is
an iterator.

% \footnote{It might be tempting to generate a warning when the
% keyword is ignored but those warnings may be spurious in a generic
% context where we are reusing an abstract function definition.}

Without the \chpl{ordered} keyword, the evaluation of \chpl{<expr>}
can proceed concurrently with evaluation of the statements as
well. Alternately, \chpl{<expr>} could be fully evaluated before any
\chpl{<block>} is evaluated.

When the \chpl{ordered} keyword is present, the only concurrency
between statements is the concurrency that is explicitly specified in
the iterator.  This allows an iterator to not only define a sequence
of values, but to impose a partial order on that sequence.
