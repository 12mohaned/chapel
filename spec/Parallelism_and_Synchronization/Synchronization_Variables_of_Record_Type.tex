A \chpl{single} variable can have \chpl{record} type but in this case
all fields must be assigned at the same time. Assignments to
individual fields are not permitted.

A \chpl{sync} variable can hold a value of \chpl{record} type but in
this case the entire record must be read and written. Reads and writes
of individual non-\chpl{const} fields are not permitted.
