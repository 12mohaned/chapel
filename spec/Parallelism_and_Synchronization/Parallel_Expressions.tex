A sequence expression preceded by an iterator expression can be
executed in parallel. The sub-expressions are evaluated once for each
iteration in the list and these sub-expressions can be evaluated
concurrently. The syntax is:
\begin{syntax}
sequence-statement:
   [index-list `in' iterator-list] expression
\end{syntax}

\begin{example}
\begin{chapel}
[i in S] f(i);
\end{chapel}
The function \chpl{f} is evaluated once for each value in \chpl{S}. \chpl{S}
may be a sequence, array, or domain.
\end{example}
