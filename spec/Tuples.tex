A tuple is an ordered set of components that allows for the
specification of a light-weight record with anonymous fields.

\subsection{Tuple Expressions}
\label{Tuple_Expressions}

A tuple expression is a comma-separated list of expressions that is
enclosed in parentheses.  The number of expressions is the size of the
tuple and the types of the expressions determine the component types
of the tuple.

The syntax of a tuple expression is given by:
\begin{syntax}
tuple-expression:
  ( expression-list )

expression-list:
  expression
  expression , expression-list
\end{syntax}

\begin{example}
The statement
\begin{chapel}
var x = (1, 2);
\end{chapel}
defines a variable \chpl{x} that is a 2-tuple containing the values
\chpl{1} and \chpl{2}.
\end{example}

\subsection{Tuple Type Definitions}
\label{Tuple_Type_Definitions}
\index{tuples!types}

A tuple type is a comma-separated list of types.  The number of types
in the list defines the size of the tuple, which is part of the
tuple's type.  The syntax of a tuple type is given by:
\begin{syntax}
tuple-type:
  ( type-list )

type-list:
  type
  type , type-list
\end{syntax}

\begin{example}
Given a tuple expression \chpl{(1, 2)}, the type of the tuple value is
\chpl{(int, int)}, referred to as a 2-tuple of integers.
\end{example}

\subsection{Tuple Assignment}
\label{Tuple_Assignment}
\index{assignment!tuples}
\index{tuples!assignment}

In tuple assignment, the compoonents of the tuple on the left-hand
side of the assignment operator are each assigned the components of
the tuple on the right-hand side of the assignment.  The assignments
are simultaneous so that each component expression on the right-hand
side is fully evaluated before being assigned to the left-hand side.

\subsection{Tuple Destructuring}
\label{Tuple_Destructuring}
\index{tuples!destructuring}

When a tuple expression appears on the left-hand side of an assignment
statement, the expression on the right-hand side is said to be {\em
destructured}.  The components of the tuple on the right-hand side are
assigned to each of the component expressions on the left-hand side.
This assignment is simultaneous in that the right-hand side is
evaluated before the assignments are made.
\begin{example}
Given two variables of the same type, x and y, they can be swapped by
the following single assignment statement:
\begin{chapel}
(x, y) = (y, x);
\end{chapel}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Variable Declarations in a Tuple}
\label{Variable_Declarations_in_a_Tuple}
\index{tuples!variable declarations}

Variables can be defined in a tuple to facilitate capturing the values
from a function that returns a tuple.  The extension to the syntax of
variable declarations is as follows:
\begin{syntax}
tuple-variable-declaration-statement:
  `config'[OPT] variable-kind tuple-variable-declaration ;

tuple-variable-declaration:
  ( identifier-list ) type-part[OPT] initialization-part
  ( identifier-list ) type-part
\end{syntax}
The identifiers defined within the \sntx{identifier-list} are declared
to be new variables in the scope of the statement.  The
\sntx{type-part} and/or \sntx{initialization-part} defines a tuple
that is destructured when assigned to the new variables.

\subsubsection{Ignoring Values with Underscore}
\label{Ignoring_Values_with_Underscore}
\index{_@\chpl{_}}

If an underscore appears as a component in a tuple expression in a
destructuring context, the expression on the right-hand side is
ignored, though it is still evaluated.

\begin{status}
Underscores are currently not treated specially.  The only way to
ignore values when destructuring a tuple is to put them into variables
that are never read.
\end{status}

\subsection{Homogeneous Tuples}
\label{Homogeneous_Tuples}
\index{tuples!homogeneous}

A homogeneous tuple is a special-case of a general tuple where the
types of the components are identical.  Homogeneous tuples have less
restrictions for how they can be indexed~(\rsec{Tuple_Indexing}).

\subsubsection{Declaring Homogeneous Tuples}
\label{Declaring_Homogeneous_Tuples}

\index{* (tuples)@\chpl{*} tuples}

A homogeneous tuple type may be specified with the following syntax if
it appears as a top-level type in a variable declaration, formal
argument declaration, return type specification, or type alias
declaration:
\begin{syntax}
homogeneous-tuple-type:
  integer-parameter-expression * type

integer-parameter-expression:
  expression
\end{syntax}
The homogeneous tuple type specification is syntactic sugar for the
type explicitly replicated a number of times equal to the
\sntx{integer-parameter-expression}.
\begin{example}
The following types are equivalent:
\begin{center}
\chpl{3*int} \hspace{2pc} \chpl{(int, int, int)}
\end{center}
\end{example}

\subsection{Tuple Indexing}
\label{Tuple_Indexing}
\index{tuples!indexing}

A tuple may be indexed into by an integer.  Indexing a tuple is given
by the following syntax:
\begin{syntax}
tuple-indexing-expression:
  expression ( integer-expression )
\end{syntax}

The result of indexing a tuple by integer $k$ is the value of the
$k$th component.  If the tuple is not homogeneous, the tuple can only
be indexed by an integer parameter.  This ensures that the type of the
indexing expression is known at compile-time.

\subsection{Formal Arguments of Tuple Type}
\label{Formal_Arguments_of_Tuple_Type}

\index{formal arguments!tuples}

\begin{status}
Formal arguments of tuple type are treated as if they were records.
Conversions are not applied to the components.
\end{status}

\subsubsection{Formal Argument Declarations in a Tuple}
\label{Formal_Argument_Declarations_in_a_Tuple}

\index{formal arguments!tuples}

\begin{status}
Formal arguments cannot be grouped together in a tuple.
\end{status}
