The begin statement spawns a computation to execute the statement
embedded in it.  Control continues simultaneously with the next
statement.  The syntax for the begin statement is given by
\begin{syntax}
begin-statement:
  `begin' statement
\end{syntax}

The semantics of the begin statement are described in more detail in
Section~\ref{Begin}.
