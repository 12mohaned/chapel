The cobegin statement spawns a computation for each of the statements
in the block-statement that it immediately precedes.  When each of
these computations finish, control continues with the next statement.
The syntax for the cobegin statement is given by
\begin{syntax}
cobegin-statement:
  `cobegin' block-statement
\end{syntax}

The semantics of the cobegin statement are described in more detail in
Section~\ref{Cobegin}.
