The for loop iterates over sequences, domains, arrays, iterators, or
any class that implements the structural iterator interface.  The
syntax of the for loop is given by:
\begin{syntax}
for-statement:
  `for' index-list `in' iterator-list `do' statement
  `for' index-list `in' iterator-list block-level-statement

index-list:
  expression [[,...]]

iterator-list:
  expression [[,...]]
  ( expression [[,...]] )
  [ expression [[,...]] ]
\end{syntax}

When there is single expression in the iterator list, that expression
is iterated over, and on each iteration, the value returned by the
iterator is assigned to the expressions in the index list and the
statement is executed.

Where there are multiple expressions in the iterator list, if they are
surrounded in parentheses or unsurrounded, the expressions are
iterated over using a zipper iteration described in
Section~\ref{Zipper_Iteration}.  If the expressions are surrounded by
brackets, they are iterated over using a tensor product iteration
described in Section~\ref{Tensor_Product_Iteration}.
