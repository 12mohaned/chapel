The select statement is a multi-way variant of the conditional
statement.  The syntax is given by:
\begin{syntax}
select-statement:
  `select' expression { when-statement [[...]] }

when-statement:
  `when' expression [[,...]] `do' statement
  `when' expression [[,...]] block-level-statement
  `otherwise' statement
\end{syntax}
Call the expression that follows the keyword \chpl{select}, the select
expression.  Each expression in the list of expressions following the
keyword \chpl{when}, the case expressions, must be able to be compared
with the select expression using the equality operator \chpl{==}.  The
first case expression that contains an expression where that
comparison is \chpl{true} will be selected and control transferred to
the associated statement.  If the comparison is always \chpl{false},
the statement associated with the keyword \chpl{otherwise}, if it
exists, will be selected and control transferred to it.  There may be
at most one \chpl{otherwise} statement and its location within the
select statement does not matter.

Each statement embedded in the {\em when-statement} has its own scope
whether or not an explicit block surrounds it.
