The use statement make symbols in a module available without accessing
them via the module name.  The syntax of the use statement is given
by:
\begin{syntax}
use-statement:
  `use' module-name ;

module-name:
  identifier
  module-name . module-name
\end{syntax}
The use statement makes symbols in the module available in the scope
where the use statement occurs.

It is an error for a variable, type or module to be defined both by a
\chpl{use} statement and by a declaration in the same scope.
Functions may be overloaded in this way.
