When multiple expressions are iterated over in a tensor product
context, they are iterated over as if they were nested in distinct for
loops.  There is no constraint on the iterators as there is in the
zipper context.

\begin{example}
The output of
\begin{chapel}
for i, j in [1..3, 4..6] do
  write(i, " ", j, " ");
\end{chapel}
is ``1 4 1 5 1 6 2 4 2 5 2 6 3 4 3 5 3 6 ''. The statement is
equivalent to
\begin{chapel}
for i in 1..3 do
  for j in 4..6 do
    write(i, " ", j, " ");
\end{chapel}
\end{example}
