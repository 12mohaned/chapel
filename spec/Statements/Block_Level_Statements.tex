\index{block level statement}
A block level statement is a category of statement that is sometimes
called for by the language syntax. A block level statement is given by
\begin{syntax}
block-level-statement:
  block-statement
  conditional-statement
  empty-statement
  select-statement
  for-statement
  forall-statement
  while-do-statement
  return-statement
  yield-statement
  atomic-statement
  cobegin-statement
  begin-statement
  serial-statement
  on-statement
\end{syntax}

Block level statements are part of the language to avoid the excessive
and unnecessary use of curly brackets.  For example, function bodies
are not required to be blocks, but must be block level statements.
