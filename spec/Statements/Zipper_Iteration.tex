When multiple expressions are iterated over in a zipper context, on
each iteration, each expression is iterated over, the values are
returned by the iterators in a tuple and assigned to the expressions
in the index list, and the statement is executed.

The shape of each iterator, the rank and the extents in each
dimension, must be identical.

\begin{example}
The output of
\begin{chapel}
for i, j in 1..3, 4..6 do
  write(i, " ", j, " ");
\end{chapel}
is ``1 4 2 5 3 6 ''.
\end{example}
