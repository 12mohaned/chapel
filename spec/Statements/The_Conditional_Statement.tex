\index{conditional statement}
The syntax for a conditional statement is given by the following
definition:
\begin{syntax}
conditional-statement:
  if expression then statement [[ else statement ]]
  if expression block-level-statement [[ else statement ]]
\end{syntax}

A conditional statement evaluates an expression of bool type.  If the
expression evaluates to true, the statement that immediately follows
the \chpl{then} keyword or, in the case where there is no \chpl{then}
keyword, the expression, is executed.  Otherwise, if the optional
else-clause exists, the statement following the \chpl{else} keyword is
executed.

If the statement that immediately follows the optional \chpl{then}
keyword is a conditional statement, the else-clause is bound to the
nearest preceding conditional statement without an else-clause that is
legal syntactically.
