\index{block}

A block is a statement or a possibly empty list of statements that
form their own scope.  A block is given by
\begin{syntax}
block-statement:
  { statements[OPT] }
  { }

statements:
  statement
  statement statements
\end{syntax}

Variables defined within a block are local
variables~(\rsec{Local_Variables}).

The statements within a block are executed serially unless the block
is in a cobegin statement~(\rsec{Cobegin}).
