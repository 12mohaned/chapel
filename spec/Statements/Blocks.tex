\index{block}
A block is a statement or list of statements that form their own
scope.  A block is given by
\begin{syntax}
block-statement:
  { statement [[,...]] }
\end{syntax}

Variables defined within a block are local
variables~\ref{Local_Variables}.

The statements within a block are executed serially unless the block
is in a cobegin statement~\ref{The_Cobegin_Statement}.
