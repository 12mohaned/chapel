------------------------------------
STRUCTURE
------------------------------------

Each top-level section (sekshun) has its own directory of the same
name.  In the directory, there is a file called sectionName.tex where
sectionName is the name of that section and directory.  There is also
a file for each subsection and subsubsection in that directory with
the name of that subsection or subsubsection as its name.  In these
names, spaces are changed to underscores, latex emphasized text flags
are removed, and question marks are changed to the character Q.

Labels are created in each section and are named identically to the
file's name.

------------------------------------
MAKE
------------------------------------

Using make invokes the script preprocess.pl to create a new tex file
spec_pl.tex.  This tex file is then used to build spec.dvi, spec.ps,
and spec.pdf.

The script creates stub files for all sections that do not exist.  In
addition, it warns of files that are not used in the spec and it warns
of files that share the same name.
