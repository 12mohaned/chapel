\subsubsection{Array Assignment}
\label{Array_Assignment}

The semantics of array assignment is that each array element is
assigned in parallel. If there are duplicate values in the sequence,
then the order of the element-wise assignments is arbitrary.

\begin{example}
\begin{chapel}
X(S) = y;
\end{chapel}
In this example \chpl{X} is an array and \chpl{S} a sequence of index
values. The execution of all $X(S_i)=y$ may occur concurrently. 
\end{example}
