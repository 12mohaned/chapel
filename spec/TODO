* Make supported parameter and type queries for ranges, domains, and
  arrays more explicit in the spec.  Most users are only realizing
  that this is possible by reading example codes.  Maybe include as
  part of the "supported functions" sections for these concepts?

* page 100: 1D arrays can be indexed with square brackets or parens;
  shouldn't any rank array be indexable with either?

* add a description of the scan operator and an example

* refactor/rewrite domain/array chapter (Brad)
