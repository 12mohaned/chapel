\subsection{Comments}
\label{Comments}

Two forms of comments are supported.  All text following the
consecutive characters \chpl{//} and before the end of the line is in
a comment.  All text following the consecutive characters \chpl{/*}
and before the consecutive characters \chpl{*/} is in a comment.

Comments, including the characters that delimit them, are ignored by
the compiler.  If the delimiters that start the comments appear within
a string literal, they do not start a comment but rather are part of
the string literal.

\subsection{White Space}
\label{White_Space}

White-space characters are spaces, tabs, and new-lines.  Aside from
delimiting comments and tokens, they are ignored by the compiler.

\subsection{Case Sensitivity}
\label{Case_Sensitivity}

Chapel is a case sensitive language so identifiers that are identical
except of the case of the characters are still different.

\subsection{Tokens}
\label{Tokens}

Tokens include identifiers, keywords, literals, operators, and
punctuation.

\subsubsection{Identifiers}
\label{Identifiers}

An identifier in Chapel is a sequence of characters that must start
with a letter, lower-case or upper-case, or an underscore, and can
include lower-case letters, upper-case letters, digits, the
underscore, and the question mark.
\begin{example}
The following are legal identifiers:
\begin{chapel}
  x, x1e, xt3, isLegalChapelIdentifier?, legal_chapel_identifier
\end{chapel}
\end{example}
