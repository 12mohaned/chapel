\subsubsection{Casts}
\label{Casts}

A cast is specified with the following syntax:
\begin{syntax}
cast-expression:
  expression : type
\end{syntax}
The expression is converted to the specified type.  Except for the
casts listed below, casts are restricted to valid explicit
conversions~(\rsec{Explicit_Conversions}).

The following casts have special meanings and do not correspond to an
explicit conversion:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  A cast to the keyword \chpl{seq} converts a tuple to a sequence as
  described in~\rsec{Conversions_Between_Sequences_and_Tuples}.
\item
  A cast to a parameter expression of integral type converts a
  sequence to a tuple as described
  in~\rsec{Conversions_Between_Sequences_and_Tuples}.
\item
  A cast from a 2-tuple to \chpl{complex} converts the 2-tuple into a
  complex where the first component becomes the real part and the
  second component becomes the imaginary part.  The size of the
  complex is determined from the size of the components based on
  implicit conversions.
\item
  A cast from any primitive type to a string literal that is a C-style
  format string creates a formatted string based on that format.
\end{itemize}
