\sekshun{Locality and Distribution}
\label{Locality_and_Distribution}

Chapel provides high-level abstractions that allow programmers to
exploit locality by defining the affinity of data and computation.
This is accomplished by associating both data objects and computations
with abstract {\em locales}. To provide a higher-level mechanism,
Chapel allows a mapping from domains to locales to be specified. This
mapping is called a {\em distribution} and it guides the placement of
elements within arrays and the placement of computations over domains.

\index{local}
\index{remote}
Throughout this section, the term {\em local} refers to data that is
associated with the locale that a computation is running on and {\em
remote} refers to data that is not. We assume that there is some
execution overhead associated with accessing data that may be remote
compared to data known to be local.

\subsection{Locales}
\label{Locales}
\index{locales}

A locale abstracts a processor or node in a parallel computer system,
or the basic component in the computer system where local memory can
be accessed uniformly.

\subsubsection{The Locale Type}
\label{The_Locale_Type}
\index{locale@\chpl{locale}}

The identifier \chpl{locale} is a primitive type that abstracts a
locale as described above.  Both data and computations can be
associated with a value of locale type. The only operators defined
over locales are the equality and inequality comparison operators.

\subsubsection{Locale Methods}
\label{Locale_Methods}
\index{Locales!methods}

The locale type supports the following methods:

\begin{protohead}
def locale.id: int;
\end{protohead}
\begin{protobody}
Returns a unique integer for each locale, from 0 to the number of
locales.
\end{protobody}

\begin{protohead}
def locale.numCores: int;
\end{protohead}
\begin{protobody}
Returns the number of processor cores available on a given locale.
\end{protobody}

\begin{protohead}
use Memory;
def locale.physicalMemory(unit: MemUnits=MemUnits.Bytes, type retType=int(64)): retType;
\end{protohead}
\begin{protobody}
Returns the amount of physical memory available on a given locale in
terms of the specified memory units (Bytes, KB, MB, or GB) using a
value of the specified return type.
\end{protobody}

\subsubsection{Predefined Locales Array}
\label{Predefined_Locales_Array}
\index{Locales@\chpl{Locales}}
\index{numLocales@\chpl{numLocales}}
\index{execution environment}

Chapel provides a predefined environment that stores information about
the locales used during program execution.  This {\em execution
environment} contains definitions for the array of locales
(\chpl{Locales}), a domain for that array (\chpl{LocaleSpace}), and
the number of locales (\chpl{numLocales}).
\begin{chapel}
config const numLocales: int;
const LocaleSpace: domain(1) = [0..numLocales-1];
const Locales: [LocaleSpace] locale;
\end{chapel}
When a program starts, a single computation is executing.  It is
running on the locale given by \chpl{Locales(0)}.

\subsubsection{The {\em here} Locale}
\label{here}
\index{here@\chpl{here}}

A predefined constant locale \chpl{here} can be used anywhere in a
Chapel program.  It refers to the locale that the current computation
is running on.

\begin{example}
The code
\begin{chapel}
on Locales(1) {
  writeln(here.id);
}
\end{chapel}
results in the output \chpl{1} because the \chpl{writeln} statement is
executed on locale 1.
\end{example}

The identifier \chpl{here} is not a keyword and can be overridden.

\subsubsection{Querying the Locale of an Expression}
\label{Querying_the_Locale_of_a_Variable}
\index{locale@\chpl{locale}}

The locale associated with an expression (where the expression is
stored) is queried using the following syntax:
\begin{syntax}
locale-access-expression:
  expression . `locale'
\end{syntax}
When the expression is a class, the access returns the locale on which
the class object exists rather than the reference to the class.  If
the expression is a value, it is considered local.  The implementation
may warn about this behavior.

\begin{example}
Given some class C, the code
\begin{chapel}
on Locales(0) {
  var x: int;
  var c: C;
  on Locales(1) {
    on Locales(2) {
      c = new C();
    }
    writeln(x.locale);
    writeln(c.locale);
  }
}
\end{chapel}
results in the output
\begin{chapel}
0
2
\end{chapel}
The variable \chpl{x} is declared and exists on \chpl{Locales(0)}.
The variable \chpl{c} is a class reference.  The reference exists
on \chpl{Locales(0)} but the object itself exists
on \chpl{Locales(2)}.  The locale access returns the locale where the
object exists.
\end{example}

\subsection{Specifying Locales for Computation}
\label{Specifying_Locales_for_Computation}

When execution is proceeding on some locale, a computation can be
associated with a different locale in two ways: via distributions as
discussed in~\rsec{Distributions} or with an \sntx{on-statement} as
discussed below.

\subsubsection{On}
\label{On}
\index{on@\chpl{on}}

The on statement controls on which locale a computation or data should
be placed.  The syntax of the on statement is given by
\begin{syntax}
on-statement:
  `on' expression `do' statement
  `on' expression block-level-statement
\end{syntax}
The locale of the expression is automatically queried as described
in~\rsec{Querying_the_Locale_of_a_Variable}.  Execution of the
statement occurs on this specified locale and then continues after
the \chpl{on-statement}.

By default, when new variables and data objects are created, they are
created in the locale where the computation is running.  This locale
can be changed by using the \chpl{on} keyword as discussed
in~\rsec{remote_variable_declarations}.

The following statements may not be lexically enclosed in
on-statements: yield-statements and return-statements.

\begin{openissue}
It may be worthwhile to allow yields in on-statments such that when a
loop iterates over an iterator, on-statements inside the iterator
control where the corresponding loop body is executed.  For example,
an iterator over a distributed tree might include an iterator over the
nodes as defined in the following code:
\begin{chapel}
class Tree {
  var left, right: Tree;
  def nodes {
    on this yield this;
    if left then
      forall t in left.nodes do
        yield t;
    if right then
      forall t in right.nodes do
        yield t;
  }
}
\end{chapel}
Given this code and a binary tree of type \chpl{Tree} stored in
variable \chpl{tree}, then we can use the \chpl{nodes} iterator to
iterate over the tree with the following code:
\begin{chapel}
forall t in tree.nodes {
  // body executed on t as specified in nodes
}
\end{chapel}
Here, each instance of the body of the \chpl{forall} loop is executed
on the locale where the corresponding object \chpl{t} is located.
This is specified in the \chpl{nodes} iterator where the \chpl{on}
keyword is used.  In the case of zipper or tensor product iteration,
the location of execution is taken from the first iterator.  This can
be overridden by explicitly using \chpl{on} in the body of the loop or
by reordering the product of iteration.
\end{openissue}

\subsubsection{Remote Variable Declarations}
\label{remote_variable_declarations}

Variables can be defined within an \sntx{on-statement} to define them
on a particular locale such that the scope of the variables is outside
the \sntx{on-statement}.  This is accomplished using a similar syntax
but omitting the \chpl{do} keyword and braces.  The syntax is given
by:
\begin{syntax}
remote-variable-declaration-statement:
  `on' expression variable-declaration-statement
\end{syntax}

\subsection{Distributions}
\label{Distributions}
\index{distributions}

A mapping from domain index values to locales is called a {\em
distribution}.

\subsubsection{Distributed Domains}
\label{Distributed_Domains}

\index{domains!distributed}
A domain for which a distribution is specified is referred to as a
{\em distributed domain}.
%A domain supports a method, \chpl{locale}, that maps index values in
%the domain to locales that correspond to the domain's distribution.

Iteration over a distributed domain implicitly executes the control
computation in the domain of the associated locale.  Similarly, when
iterating over the elements of an array defined over a distributed
domain, the controlled computations are determined by the distribution
of the domain.  If there are conflicting distributions in product
iterations, the locale of the computation is taken to be the first
component in the product.

\begin{example}
If \chpl{D} is a distributed domain, then in the code
\begin{chapel}
forall d in D {
  // body
}
\end{chapel}
the body of the loop is executed in the locale where the
index \chpl{d} maps to by the distribution of \chpl{D}.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Distributed Arrays}
\label{Distributed_Arrays}
\index{arrays!distributed}

Arrays defined over a distributed domain will have the element
variables stored on the locale determined by the distribution.  Thus,
if \chpl{d} is an index of distributed domain \chpl{D} and \chpl{A} is
an array defined over that domain, then \chpl{A(d).locale} is the
locale to which \chpl{d} maps to according to \chpl{D}.

\subsubsection{Undistributed Domains and Arrays}
\label{Undistributed_Domains_and_Arrays}

If a domain or an array does not have a distributed part, the domain
or array is not distributed and exists only on the locale on which it
is defined.

\subsection{Standard Distributions}
\label{Standard_Distributions}

Standard distributions include the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The block distribution \chpl{Block}
\item The cyclic distribution \chpl{Cyclic}
\item The block-cyclic distribution \chpl{BlockCyclic}
\item The cut distribution \chpl{Cut}
\end{itemize}

A design goal is that all standard distributions are defined with the
same mechanisms that user-defined
distributions~(\rsec{User_Defined_Distributions}) are defined with.

\subsection{User-Defined Distributions}
\label{User_Defined_Distributions}

This section is forthcoming.
