Chapel itself.  Current subdirectories include:

dlmalloc/
  Summary: Doug Lea's memory allocator (dlmalloc) which we use to
           support malloc/free calls when running GASNet programs
           using segment fast.

gasnet/
  Summary: the Berkeley GASNet library for one-sided communication
           which we use as a communication layer to implement Chapel's
           support for multi-locale/distributed-memory systems.
