==========================
PVM for Chapel development
==========================

This copy of PVM has been imported into Chapel's source tree for
convenience and is a snapshot of PVM version 3.4.6 obtained from
Netlib at: http://www.netlib.org/pvm3/index.html

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to PVM should be directed to
the Chapel team at chapel-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net, as the cause is
most likely due to Chapel's use of PVM and not the PVM library itself.

We have taken the liberty of removing the pvm3/src/regex and
pvm3/src/OS2/Makefile.reg files from our copy of the distribution in
order to avoid potential confusion around files distributed under the
GPL license and due to reports from ORNL that these files are no
longer needed.  Otherwise, the source is unchanged.

The structure of this directory is as follows:

./
  Makefile        : a Makefile to help build PVM for Chapel's use
  README          : this file
  pvm-3.4.6/      : a container directory to support multiple pvm versions
    pvm3/         : the official PVM release, with the above modifications
