GASNet for Chapel release
=========================

This copy of GASNet is being released with Chapel for convenience and
is a snapshot of GASNet version 1.12.0 obtained from UC Berkeley at:
http://gasnet.cs.berkeley.edu

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to GASNet should be directed
to the Chapel team at chapel_bugs@cray.com, as the cause is most
likely due to Chapel's use of GASNet and not the GASNet library
itself.

The modifications that we have made to the official release are as
follows:

* added support for launching an xterm window running gdb in the udp
  active messages layer if the environment variable CHPL_COMM_USE_GDB
  is set.  Our modification is not particularly elegant, but it should
  be innocuous for non-Chapel developers, and has been exceedingly
  useful for the Chapel development team.

We have also applied a number of patches from the GASNet team that
will be made available in future versions of GASNet:

* one that fixes some IBM xlc compilation issues related to offsetof()
  macros.

* one that fixes runtime crashes due to insufficient alignment of
  arguments to the cmpxchg16b instruction present on many recent
  x86_64 processors (see
  http://upc.lbl.gov/download/patch/berkeley_upc-2.8.0-patch1.shtml).

* one co-developed by the Chapel team that addresses the use of
  cnos/PMI calls in the portals conduit.

* one that disables the building of the portals conduit when segment
  everything has been specified.

* one which supports a -T option for the Bootstrap script that touches
  the autoconf-generated files in the appropriate order in cases when
  timestamps are not preserved (such as being stored in our source
  repository)

The structure of this directory is as follows:
