=========================
GASNet for Chapel release
=========================

This copy of GASNet is being released with Chapel version 0.8 for
convenience and is a snapshot of GASNet version 1.12.0 obtained from
UC Berkeley at: http://gasnet.cs.berkeley.edu

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to GASNet should be directed
to the Chapel team at chapel_bugs@cray.com, as the cause is most
likely due to Chapel's use of GASNet and not the GASNet library
itself.

The structure of this directory is as follows:

./
  Makefile        : a Makefile to help build GASNet for Chapel's use
  README          : this file
  GASNet-1.12.0/  : the official GASNet release, with the above modifications
  install/        : as GASNet is built it will be installed here:
    $CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM-$CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER/
      seg-$CHPL_GASNET_SEGMENT/
        nodbg/
