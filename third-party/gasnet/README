=========================
GASNet for Chapel release
=========================

This copy of GASNet is being released with Chapel version 0.8 for
convenience and is a snapshot of GASNet version 1.12.0 obtained from
UC Berkeley at: http://gasnet.cs.berkeley.edu

The only modification to the source code that we made was to add
support for launching an xterm window running gdb in the udp active
messages layer if the environment variable CHPL_COMM_USE_GDB is set
(which the Chapel runtime does if a generated executable is run with
the --gdb flag).  Our modification is not particularly elegant, but it
should be innocuous for non-Chapel developers, and has been
exceedingly useful for the Chapel development team.

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to GASNet should be directed
to the Chapel team at chapel_bugs@cray.com, as the cause is most
likely due to Chapel's use of GASNet and not the GASNet library
itself.

The structure of this directory is as follows:

./
  Makefile        : a Makefile to help build GASNet for Chapel's use
  README          : this file
  GASNet-1.12.0/  : the official GASNet release, with the above modifications
  install/        : as GASNet is built it will be installed here:
    $CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM-$CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER/
      seg-$CHPL_GASNET_SEGMENT/
        nodbg/
