Chapel third-party directory : for developers
=============================================

This directory contains the following subdirectories, which we
currently do not make available to users:

armci/   : PNNL's ARMCI library for one-sided communication
mpich1/  : MPICH version 1 implementation of MPI
txt2man/ : a shell script utility for converting text files to man pages

Licensing information for each package should be available in its
separate directory.
