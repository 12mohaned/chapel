                             Issues to be Resolved

         prior to merging the hierarchical_locales branch back to trunk


o Get rid of calls to PRIM_CHPL_ALLOC in generated code

o Whether to interpose an alloc(loc, nbytes, md) layer between chpl_here_alloc()
  and locale.alloc()
  i The intent is to avoid dynamic dispatch through "here"
    i Works only if binding of code to allocators can be made at compile time

* Whether to pass the destination locale to chpl_here_alloc() [no]
  i Not necessary using the "proxy" model
