                             Issues to be Resolved

         prior to merging the hierarchical_locales branch back to trunk


NEW/CHANGED:

o Replace all calls to PRIM_CHPL_ALLOC with chpl_here_alloc.
  > Fix deallocation-before-breakLabel (memory leak) bug.
   
o Whether to interpose an alloc(loc, nbytes, md) layer between chpl_here_alloc()
  and locale.alloc()
  i The intent is to avoid dynamic dispatch through "here"
    i Works only if binding of code to allocators can be made at compile time

o Fix deallocation-before-breakLabel bug, so we can use LAMM to allocate
  iterator state data.

o Ensure that all important cases are covered by chpl_maybeAutoDestroyed().

* Whether to pass the destination locale to chpl_here_alloc() [no]
  i Not necessary using the "proxy" model


RESOLVED/UNCHANGED:
