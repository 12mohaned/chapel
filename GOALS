==================================
Chapel Public Release (v0.8) Goals
==================================

The goals of this release are as follows:

* to demonstrate Chapel's base language features

* to demonstrate Chapel's task parallel features in a multi-threaded,
  multi-locale setting

* to demonstrate Chapel's data parallel features via a combination of
  (i)  a single-threaded, single-locale implementation; and
  (ii) a *very* initial/limited multi-threaded, multi-locale implementation

* to give the general public an opportunity to see the state and
  evolution of the Chapel implementation first-hand

* to get feedback on the Chapel language and its ongoing
  implementation (please direct to chapel_info@cray.com)
