==================================
Chapel Public Release (v0.9) Goals
==================================

The goals of this release are as follows:

* to demonstrate Chapel's base language features

* to demonstrate Chapel's task parallel features in a multi-threaded,
  multi-locale setting

* to demonstrate Chapel's data parallel features via a combination of
  (i)   a multi-threaded, single-locale implementation for ranges, and
        non-distributed arithmetic domains and arrays;
  (ii)  a single-threaded, single-locale reference implementation for
        sparse, associative, and opaque domains and arrays; and
  (iii) a preliminary multi-threaded, multi-locale implementation for
        distributed arithmetic domains and arrays

* to give the general public an opportunity to see the state and
  evolution of the Chapel implementation first-hand

* to get feedback on the Chapel language and its ongoing
  implementation (please direct to chapel_info@cray.com)
